Hey all. As you may have noticed if you had it marked on your calendars, we did not open to submissions today as planned. We've gotten a ton of good stuff in our previous two periods, and that, along with some internal reorganization going on at Fireside, means we thought it best to cancel the submissions periods this month and in July. We'll be open again in the fall. Full details are available on [our submissions page](http://firesidefiction.com/about/#submissions-guidelines). Thanks so much!
