Fireside will be open to fiction submissions of up to 4,000 words during the last week of April. We’ll have our submissions portal open from the 23rd to the 27th of April, but we wanted to let everyone know now so you have time to polish up your work, or write us something brand new. As always, we will need a lot more flash than longer work, so please do send us your best shorter pieces if you have them. 4,000 words is our upper limit, but we also like to see shorter stories that aren’t flash. [You can read our guidelines here.](http://firesidefiction.com/about/#submissions-guidelines)
