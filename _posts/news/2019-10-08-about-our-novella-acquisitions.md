On Monday morning, I sent out messages reverting the rights on five unpublished and unannounced manuscripts that we acquired last year during our novel and novella acquisitions period.  In the last day or so there’s been lots of rumor and speculation, so I wanted to explain what’s going on directly.

We’ve had some [unexpected changes](/editorial-changes-at-fireside) on the editorial front at Fireside this year. Any time there’s a change like that, it affects workflow, capacity, and resourcing throughout, especially at very small operations like ours. Over the past few months, as I’ve reworked our editorial operations to account for [working with more people than ever before](/announcing-our-2020-guest-editors), it’s become clear to me that the amount of work that I’d previously thought Fireside could take on was unsustainable. Trying to take on too much work would have made living up to our obligations to our authors extremely challenging. It would have been bad both for Fireside and for these authors and their work. So rather than publishIng these books badly, I made the decision to cut down on our upcoming list.

This sucks no matter how you slice it, but it would have sucked more down the line. As I told each author, this is not a reflection on their work. There’s a reason we were attracted to these manuscripts in the first place — they’re great stories, and I have no doubt that they will find good homes. But I’d much rather revert the rights to these books back to their authors, than do a bad job publishing their work, or worse: sit on the rights until the contracts expired.

We’ll be focusing Fireside’s resources on the books that we have announced, and which we already have in production; the production of _Fireside Quarterly_; and two one-off projects that are also in progress, which you’ll all hear about soon.
