We are super excited to announce that Hal Y. Zhang will be the guest editor for our next submissions period, which will run from July 5 through July 11, 2021.

Hal Y. Zhang is a lapsed physicist who splits her time between the east coast of the United States and the Internet. Her prose and poetry are at _Uncanny Magazine_, _Strange Horizons_, _Future Tense_, and _Fireside Magazine_, and she is on the editorial staff at _Reckoning_. Her language-and-loss chapbook, _AMNESIA_ (Newfound, 2020), won the Eric Hoffer Micro Press Award, and her women-with-sharp-things collection, _Goddess Bandit of the Thousand Arms_, was published by Aqueduct Press. She is online at [https://halyzhang.com/halyzhang.com](halyzhang.com) and [https://twitter.com/halyzhang](@halyzhang).

Hal will be accepting both short stories and poetry for three monthly issues that will be published in 2022. She would especially love to see work loosely themed around science and technology: the joy of discovery, the systemic barriers in place that prevent equal access to advanced knowledge, and how new tools and machines can both empower and disenfranchise marginalized voices. Don't limit yourself to strictly future settings or science fiction — think broadly in terms of any method or system that explores the world through experimentation, such as an ancient sorcerer investigating rules of magic.

Each writer can submit one short story and one poem during this submissions period. Please read our [general submission guidelines](https://firesidefiction.com/submissions) for more information about things like story length and what we do and don't accept. When submissions open, the link to submit will be on that page as well. You can [sign up for our newsletter](https://firesidefictioncompany.us7.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=0c60ee4cf297215c61d55e861&id=afc8f5cf09) if you’d like a reminder when we open (as well as weekly stories in your inbox), and we’ll also post a reminder [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/FiresideFiction).

Get those stories and poems ready! We can’t wait to see what y’all send in.
