We’re pleased to announce that we’ll be publishing Sarah Gailey’s Serial, [_The Fisher of Bones_](/book/the-fisher-of-bones), in its entirety as a print and ebook on October 24—and you can [pre-order the ebook on Amazon right now](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075PGX6YJ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1505916410&sr=8-2&keywords=the+fisher+of+bones)!

That's right: if you buy the book on October 24, you'll be able to read the whole thing before we're done posting serial episodes. So if you just. can't. wait. to find out whether Fisher gets her people home (and take it from me, you will have Strong Feelings about how this tale ends), you'll be able to scratch your itch next month.

We’re also incredibly pleased to reveal the cover for the trade print and ebook editions of _The Fisher of Bones_, sporting an illustration by none other than [Miranda Meeks](http://mirandameeks.com). Miranda’s stunning illustration features Fisher, our protagonist, standing defiant in front of a fire. She’s holding the tablets she’s using to lead her people, she’s very, very pregnant, and she looks badass. I couldn't be happier with this cover art—Miranda has been a delight to work with.

Here's the full landscape artwork, which will wrap around the cover of the print edition (click to embiggen):

And here's the front cover:

We hope you're (almost) as excited about this as we are (we're pretty damn excited, to be honest).
