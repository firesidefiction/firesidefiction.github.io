That’s it folks, that’s the show: we have now published everything on our editorial calendar for 2018. And we published a lot. Short short stories, long short stories, and plenty of things that were not stories at all.

_Fireside Magazine_, which is eligible in the Best Semiprozine category for the Hugo Awards, published 52 stories, 11 essays, 12 illustrations and one illustrated poem in 2018. We collected each month’s worth of stories and artwork into the 12 issues of the monthly ebook magazine that we send to our subscribers, and in July we began collecting three months’ worth of stories, essays, and artwork into [_Fireside Quarterly_](https://firesidefiction.com/subscribe), the new print edition of Fireside which hits our subscribers’ mailboxes every three months.

Separately, Fireside also published the yearly installment of [the #BlackSpecFic Report along with its supporting essays](/blackspecfic); we also lent a hand with the publication of [_A Larger Reality_, the Mexicanx Initiative anthology](https://www.mexicanxinitiative.com/mexicanx-anthology), as well as [the scrapbook website](https://www.mexicanxinitiative.com/scrapbook/) commemorating the event.

This year we also began Fireside Press, our line of longer-form work. Fireside Press published one novella and two novels, and we’re just getting started. Expect more over time on this front.

Last year we brought on Julia Rios to replace Brian White as editor of _Fireside Magazine_, and this year we had some staff changes too. We brought on Meg Frank as our community coordinator, and we said goodbye to our managing editor, Elsa Sjunneson — but not before she edited a few nonfiction essays for us.

As we close out the year, we want to celebrate our contributors, so we’ve put together this list of all the stories we published in 2018. If you have a favorite among these, let us know on Twitter, we’d love to hear about it!

If you are nominating for the various awards, we’ve labelled everything appropriately. We’ve also listed the [artists](#artists) who we’ve commissioned artwork for in 2018, The [special projects](#related-works) we've participated in, and the [editors](#our-editors) we’ve worked with who are eligible for awards.
