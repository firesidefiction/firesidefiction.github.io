teaser: "Here's the cover for the next issue of Fireside Quarterly!"
---

We hope you’ve been enjoying the debut issue of Fireside Quarterly—and if you haven't gotten your hands on one yet, there's still time! If you [subscribe today](#subscribe), we'll send you the current issue immediately.

We’re hard at work putting together the next issue, which hits subscribers' mailboxes in October, and we’ve gotten the cover dialed in enough now that we’re ready to share a sneak peak with you!

This issue’s cover art is by [Satu Kettunen](https://satukettunen.com), and the full illustration it’s based on was commissioned to accompany Sara Norja’s short story, "Birch Daughter." Sara is from Finland, so we worked to find a Finnish artist to visually interpret her beautiful story about finding love in captivity, and making your escape.

Satu’s collage-like style suits this story beautifully—the way she combines stamp-like graphical elements on top of her figures gives her work a lovely, layered look that doesn’t feel cluttered, but still conveys a sense of depth that’s consonant with the forest setting of the story. 

We hope you enjoy this sneak peek at the cover art. We can’t wait for you to see the full illustration with you when the October issue drops this fall. In the meantime, thanks for subscribing—and spread the word!
