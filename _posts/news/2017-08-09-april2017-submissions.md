For a week this April, we were open to short-story submissions of up to 4,000 words. We received 850 submissions and accepted 8, an acceptance rate of 0.94 percent.

This was our second submissions period in which we asked submitters to take a quick, anonymous, 100% voluntary survey in which we asked people’s race and ethnicity. (You can read the results of the first survey [here](http://firesidefiction.com/march2017-submissions-results)).

This is part of our effort in the wake of [our first #BlackSpecFic report](/blackspecfic-2015) to get a better understanding of who is submitting to Fireside, so we can continue working on our mission of inclusivity. ([Our second #BlackSpecFic report](/blackspecfic) just wrapped up last week.)

Of the 850 submitters, 735 responded to the survey, or about 86 percent, the same response rate as the first survey. While this is not a scientific survey and we cannot verify the responses, we’re very happy that so many people continue to participate, as we feel it gives us a solid look at who is submitting to Fireside.

Also as before, there were only a few jackass responses, including “_Decline to state. Please stop perpetuating myths of ethnicity by acknowleding them. Other than isozyme variants in a few genes here and there, this concept should be gone within about seven generations of global travel_” and someone  who said that they were white but thought it was helpful to add that they had non-white daughters in law and once lived near a Native American reservation. Three dipshits filled in “Human” as their race.

Whatever.

Here are the results of the survey in a graphic. (People could select multiple options, and they could also fill in a text box under other):

And in plain text:
-	Black 59 (8.0%)
-	Hispanic/Latinx 32 (4.4%)
-	Asian/Pacific Islander 54 (7.3%)
-	First Peoples/Native American/Native Canadian 19 (2.6%)
-	White 569 (77.4 %)

Categories that received more than one fill-in vote included: 4 Indian, 4 African, 3 Arab, and 3 Middle Eastern.

If you’re interested in digging in deeper, the full spreadsheet of responses can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aCYgDIq0jq-iltMmLlFNTCi5MuWGpcSKR-F5QaIlfSQ/edit?usp=sharing)
This is only our second data point. We’ll be collecting the same information on all of our submissions periods for the foreseeable future, and we’ll continue to post the results.

And now! Here are the stories we bought from April:
