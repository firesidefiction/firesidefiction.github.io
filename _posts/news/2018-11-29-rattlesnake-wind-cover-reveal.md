Rattlesnake Wind is the story of Dez Thomson, whose family — now without their domineering patriarch — is busy creating a new life on Wyoming’s plains. To Dez, magic hides in the grass, and especially in the wind — and she is about to find out that magic is real, bloody, and on the hunt for the perfect victims.

Our cover is illustrated by [Elanor Chuah](http://elanorchuah.com), a Malaysian illustrator whose work centers around narrative illustrations. Over the course of the novel, Dez learns how to listen to the wind, with the help of a new friend. Her ability to listen is like an extra sense, and we wanted to communicate a little of that, along with the alienation that Dez feels as someone who recently moved to town and has few friends. Elanor managed to capture this mood beautifully in a lovely illustration that puts Dez front and center.

_Rattlesnake Wind_ is a deep, layered work — a view into the mind of a young woman trying to come to grips with the world around her, her place in it, and her relationships with the men in her life. We’re so proud that Lili entrusted us with this fantastic work, and we can’t wait for you to get your hands on it.
