We have an update about the submissions period that was open in late January and early February for issues with guest editor Brandon O'Brien.

Unfortunately, like many of us over the last year, Brandon has recently been facing some unexpected challenges, and he made the difficult decision to step down as a guest editor. We regretfully accepted and hope to work with him again sometime in the future.

Aigner Loren Wilson has graciously agreed to step in and take over the role from Brandon. Aigner is a SFWA, HWA, and Codex writer who hails from the Lenapehoking coast. She writes poetry, nonfiction, in-game stories, and fiction. (You can check out her books, games, and courses on her [website](https://hausofcrows.com/).) Aigner is an associate editor and copy editor for the award-winning magazine Strange Horizons and horror podcast Nightlight with work appearing or forthcoming from _Lightspeed Magazine_, _Anathema_, _FIYAH_, _Tordotcom_, _Tor Nightfire_, and more.

We're absolutely thrilled to have her on board and excited to see what direction she'll take with her selections.

We've contacted all the writers waiting on responses to their submissions to let them know about this change. If you are a writer who submitted your work to us and you didn't receive that email, please check your spam filters; if there's nothing there, please shoot me an email at [brian@firesidefiction.com](mailto:brian@firesidefiction.com). We've had a few issues with emails not reaching people recently and we want to make sure that no one is being left hanging.

Brian J. White

Interim Editorial Director
