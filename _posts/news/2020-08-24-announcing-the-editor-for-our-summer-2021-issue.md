I hope you’ve been enjoying the stories from our Summer issue, edited by Kate Dollarhyde. We opened the month with Eleanna Castroianni’s “(An Incomplete Account of the Case of the Bird-Talker of Yaros)[https://firesidefiction.com/an-incomplete-account-of-the-case-of-the-bird-talker-of-yaros],” a beautiful tale of resistance in captivity, illustrated by Pao-ju Lin, and followed up with “(Down)[https://firesidefiction.com/down]” by Jo Kaplan, and “(Worm Song)[https://firesidefiction.com/worm-song],” by David Naimon. All three are stories about resilience in one form or another, which we need these days more than ever.

If you’ve subscribed to our print magazine, _Fireside Quarterly_, then you’ve already got the rest of this issue’s stories in your hands, so you know that this is just the tip of the iceberg. If you haven’t (subscribed)[https://firesidefiction.memberful.com/checkout?plan=25789] yet, you’re missing out.

Production continues apace: our upcoming Autumn 2020 issue, edited by Maurice Broaddus, is off to press and audio production, and will be shipping to subscribers in October—expect a cover reveal soon! Meanwhile, Danny Lore just finished editing the Winter 2020 issue and has handed it off to Chelle Parker for copyediting, while Ryan Boyd is putting together their final selection for the table of contents of the Spring 2021 issue.

Around here, when we send one issue off to press, we spin up production on the next one—and that means kicking off a new submissions period. As we’ve listed on the site, the submissions period for our Summer 2021 issue starts tomorrow, and goes until Friday. So if you’re of the writerly sort, read our submissions guidelines and send us your stories!

This is an odd one, too: since we’ve pushed production back in the ongoing quest for more buffer time in our production schedule, we’ve hit a weird spot where we’re going to have overlapping reading periods, since Ryan is still putting together their TOC for the Sprint 2021 issue. But the overlap should be short-lived: the TOC will be finished by the end of this month, and acceptances and rejections for the Spring 2021 issue will go out by then.

And, I’m very excited to announce that the Summer 2021 issue of FIreside Quarterly will be edited by none other than Yanni Kuznia! Yanni Kuznia is a lifelong bibliophile who grew up wanting to be in comic book movies. She is a classically trained actress, a Russian and Crusades historian, went to stunt school in Toronto, runs 5k and 10k races, and picked up watercolor painting after deciding to finish her eldest's aborted paint-by-number attempt. Yanni is currently working her dream job as COO and Managing Editor of Subterranean Press. We’re super excited to work with Yanni, and can’t wait to share her issue with you next year. 

In the meantime, thanks for reading, as always.
