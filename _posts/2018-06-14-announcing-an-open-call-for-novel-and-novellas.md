Fireside will be open to novel and novella submissions for the month of August! Please send us all of the following: 

- Your completed novel or novella (20,000-120,000 words)

- A query letter with the title, genre, length, a short pitch of the concept, and a short bio

- A synopsis, up to 2,000 words (but shorter is definitely okay!) consisting of a detailed outline of your story, including any major plot twists and the ending

We will be open to all genres as long as the story transports us. We especially would love to see work from underrepresented voices including POC, disabled, and LGBTQIA+ voices, and we believe strongly that any story you want to tell is a valid story, regardless of whether it centers issues related to being part of a marginalized group. 

Fireside offers royalties on sales of all books. All titles we choose from this period will be scheduled for a 2019 release. 

We will post a submissions link in August 1, 2018, and aim to respond to all submissions by the end of October 2018.

Simultaneous submissions are okay for novels and novellas, but we ask that you please withdraw immediately if you take another offer.
