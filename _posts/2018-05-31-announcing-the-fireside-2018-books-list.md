I’m pleased to announce that starting this fall, Fireside will begin publishing a small number of novels and novellas. We’ve dipped our toes into these waters before, but we’re excited to spin up our books publishing program in earnest. Our initial list is small, but really special, and it’s the start of something bigger. Beginning this fall, Fireside will be publishing the following titles:

**_Every River Runs to Salt_, a novella by [Rachael K. Jones](https://twitter.com/rachaelkjones):**
The Pacific Ocean is a big thing to steal, but Quietly's roommate Imani never does anything small. But then Imani goes and dies, and Quietly is left to travel to the Under-Ath (the underworld beneath Athens, Georgia), with angry gods at her heels, to clean up the mess Imani left behind and try to rescue her friend.

**_Gunsmoke & Glamour_, a novel by [Hillary Monahan](https://twitter.com/HillaryMonahan):**
Marshall Clayton Jensen's job is to fix things for the people too weird for the government to touch--witches, fairies, monsters. When Clay finds himself on the receiving end of a witch's curse following a breakup from the love of his life, a fairy named Cora, Clay enlists the help of his best friend Doc Irene and his ex-girlfriend's promiscuous sister Adelaide to search for a cure before time runs out.

**_Rattlesnake Wind_, a novel by [Lilith Saintcrow](https://twitter.com/lilithsaintcrow):**
Dez Thompson’s family—now without their domineering patriarch—is busy creating a new life on Wyoming’s plains. To Dez, magic hides in the grass, and especially in the wind--and she is about to find out that magic is real, bloody, and on the hunt for the perfect victims.

Each book will be available as a print and ebook at all major retailers, as well as at the Fireside Shop. We’re incredibly excited about each of these titles, so you can expect us to talk much more about them in the coming months, including announcing publication dates and cover reveals. We also have a few more surprises up our sleeve, which we’ll announce when the time is right.
