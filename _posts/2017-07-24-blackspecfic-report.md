A couple of years ago, we[^1] noticed an alarming pattern in speculative fiction publications: while sometimes diverse in other ways, they published few to no stories by black writers. Our [2015 investigation](https://medium.com/fireside-fiction-company/antiblack-racism-in-speculative-fiction-7e30eff97008) of over 60 science fiction and fantasy magazines confirmed those perceptions. Only about 2% of the original stories we could find in the field were black-authored. Given that people of the African diaspora make up about 13% of the U.S. and 20% of the globe, the discrepancy disturbed us. And the math suggested that there was no possible way this lack of representation was random happenstance.[^2]

A year after our initial report, many questions remain. To what extent is this problem due to submissions and to acceptances? And while it is almost assuredly both, how does the recursive nature between the two work? The sample and data points we have can’t fully answer those. There are questions for which numbers alone are inadequate to answer, and we think this is one of them. The data collected here seeks answers to other questions, the most important of which in our view is: within this structurally racist state of affairs, how are new writers faring? What happens when we take a deeper look at the field?


## 2015-2016

We limited this analysis to science fiction, fantasy, and horror magazines that pay professional rates as defined by SFWA, have been in existence for at least two years, and are open to general submissions. For both 2015 and 2016, we included additional data points: the number of unique writers, both black and overall, and the number of stories by new black authors.

We are considering the field both with and without the “People of Colo(u)r Destroy!”_ _special issues of _Lightspeed_, _Nightmare_, and _Fantasy Magazine_, since they constitute a project that is limited to one year. Without these issues, a sample of 24 professional SF/F/H magazines yielded 31 stories by black authors out of 1,089 total stories -- that’s 2.8% -- while 2.9% of 2016’s published unique authors are black. In 2015 we found figures of 1.9% and 2.4%, respectively. While there’s no way to determine yet if these small increases are evidence of gradual long-term improvement or just normal variation -- two years is too short a trajectory for that -- perhaps we can find a cautious degree of optimism.

In our view, there’s a greater reason for hopefulness.

Almost half (45%) of the stories by black writers we found in these two years are by very new authors. Of the remainder, most of the authors are more recognizable within short fiction circles but have not yet published multiple books with large presses or won several literary awards. In the wake of the 2015 BlackSpecFic Report, many worried that the overwhelming majority of these few stories are by authors with household names; this is not the case. The 41 authors currently represented in the field possess a wide variation in experience and publication history.


## Effects of the “People of Colo(u)r Destroy!” Issues

In spite of comprising a tiny portion of the field’s story volume, the “PoC Destroy” issues collectively contained over 20% of 2016’s stories by black authors. They alone raise the field-wide ratio nearly a full percentage point, from 2.8% to 3.6%.

This improvement is a major accomplishment of these issues’ editors. Speaking in a strictly quantitative sense, though, considering these issues’ scope and _especially_ their size, a percentage increase of this magnitude should not have been possible, and would not be in a field that was healthy. This is not an argument for or against diversity-themed issues, a nuanced subject, but rather a quantitative look at what they illustrate about the whole: if such a small part of the field can serve as a release valve for that much built-up pressure, that field is simply not functioning as it should.

As a further example, the “PoC Destroy” issues appear to have more than doubled Afro-Caribbean representation.


## Individual Magazines

While these figures indicate an existential problem for the field as a whole, [some magazines are performing better than others](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qbPDBXLS5jRcpU5LHvkdXaBOlajRy0hrvLvLw3rfVFk/edit?usp=sharing). The bulk of stories by black authors published in 2015 and 2016 were in fact published in the exact same magazines.


![](/images/graphics/blackspecfic2016-3.png)


The 9 professional magazines in this image constitute about 25% of the field’s story volume, and over the course of 2015-2016, they published:

- About 65% of the stories by black authors.
- About 80% of unique black authors (as opposed to less than 40% in the 15 magazines not pictured).
- About 75% of the stories by new black authors.

In other words, according to every available metric, one fourth of the field is publishing the vast majority of its black work. There are disclaimers associated with the individual magazine data; however, the more information we collect, the more it points to a problem that can’t be explained by field-wide submission rates alone. If it could be, why would the distribution be so uneven?

Furthermore, if the magazines that aren’t portrayed in this graphic caught up to the ones that are, the number of stories by black authors in the field would theoretically more than triple.


## Where Do We Go From Here?

Again, we think there’s reason to have a degree of hope. Some magazines made substantive changes to their editorial staffs and marketing strategies subsequent to the 2015 report, which was released late enough last year that any resulting improvements would impact only 2017 and beyond. It’s for this reason that this 2016 follow-up is not a comparative analysis but rather should serve as a baseline for comparison in future years.

Progress isn’t always linear; not all magazines have equal resources or lead times, which is why we want to hear from **editors and publishers**. What are your strategies for combating low publication rates of black authors? Please answer our survey to let us know.

**Black SF/F writers,** we’d like to hear your comments and suggestions for how we can improve future reports. This also goes for data collection; we’re working purely from what’s publicly available on the Internet, and we don’t want to force people to publicly self-identify in order to be counted. If you suspect your stories are not included in this count and would like them to be, just want to double check, or have any other concerns -- please let us know. Our gmail address is BlackSpecFicReport; correspondence will be kept confidential.

**Readers**: this particular section of the report isn’t the source of many answers. For those, see the upcoming roundtables and essays as well as last year’s. Support [_Fiyah Magazine_](http://www.fiyahlitmag.com/). And remember that, while we live in a world that tries to convince us differently, “fault” and “responsibility” look similar but are actually fundamentally different paradigms.

[^1]: 1 — Author’s note: I use the first person plural throughout this article because many of its related decisions were derived via collective processes (though as their final arbiter, accountability for them rests on me).<br/>How this article almost began: “A major flaw of contemporary journalism is its feigned objectivity. This is largely accomplished by the removal of the writer as an actor; in most journalistic endeavors, the word ‘I’ never appears. And so, in writing up these findings, I found myself with two conflicting imperatives: my perspective is not very important (over the coming days, you'll hear from some that are), and yet to remove myself entirely would reinforce the very problem this report seeks to redress: to play into that dynamic would be to pretend that a white person didn't write this, would reify the mistaken conception held by whiteness that its perspective on racism is the most neutral and objective when it is in fact the least.” I decided, insofar as such is possible, to remove myself from the article -- these numbers don’t need me to narrate the story they tell -- and confine my presence to the footnotes. However, given that 2015’s report received more scrutiny than nuclear power safety codes are subject to, and because identifying one’s positioning is important in these sorts of matters anyway, a clarification: I do not have official affiliations with any short fiction magazine in the field. (Nor have I ever submitted to any.) The only financial relationship I have is payment for this article. I do have many personal relationships in the field (indeed, I am friendly with several of its editors, most of whom do not come off well here), which is how this report ended up at Fireside rather than elseweb. White writers who complain to me or Fireside about these numbers (rather than who they should be complaining to: their own editors) need to make these kinds of disclosures.
