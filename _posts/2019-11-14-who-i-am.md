i told you i was a river<br/>
and you bathed in me,<br/>
leaving me cleaner.<br/>
with rocks from my bed<br/>
you lined your walls,<br/>
and now i am home.<br/>

i rush and tumble and<br/>
speak in tongues,<br/>
but you lean your ear and<br/>
smile at the right parts.<br/>

someday, i may wear you down,<br/>
erode the years until<br/>
i've pushed you out to the sea.<br/>
until then, i feed the grasses<br/>
all along my banks and<br/>
encourage them to bloom.<br/>
someday, i may feed flowers.<br/>

i told you i was a river<br/>
and you took the news solemnly.<br/>
if you put your candles on me,<br/>
i will float them safely out.
