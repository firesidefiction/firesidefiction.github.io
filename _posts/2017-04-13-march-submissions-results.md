We were open to flash fiction submissions (stories of 1,000 words or less) last month. We received 567 stories and accepted 17, an acceptance rate just a hair under 3 percent. The stories run the gamut of genres, with an especially healthy dose of fairy tales.

This was also our first submissions period in which we asked submitters to take a quick, anonymous, 100% voluntary survey in which we asked people's race and ethnicity. This is part of our effort in the wake of our [#BlackSpecFic report](https://medium.com/fireside-fiction-company/blackspecfic-571c00033717) to get a better understanding of who is submitting to Fireside, so we can continue working on [our mission of inclusivity](http://firesidefiction.com/values#4-commitment-to-inclusive-representation).

Of the 567 submitters, 488 people responded to the survey, or 86 percent. While this is not a scientific survey and we cannot verify the responses, we're very happy that so many people participated as we feel it gives us a solid look at the  submissions pool for the period.

There were only a few jackass responses, including "I am uncomfortable with this- I see all humanity as one race, with genetic differentials that aid in adapting to environmental conditions" and "Officially old" and "Human".

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Here are the results of the survey in a graphic. (People could select multiple options, and they could also fill in a text box under other:

![Survey](/images/graphics/march2017-survey.png)

And in plain text:

- Black: 37 (7.6%)
- Hispanic/Latinx: 30 (6.1%)
- Asian/Pacific Islander: 33 (6.8%)
- First Peoples/Native American/Native Canadian 14 (2.9%)
- White: 389 (79.7%)
- Other: 37 (7.6%)

If you're interested in digging in deeper, [the full spreadsheet of responses can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bTzq7qopshOe7PPSMCziSO4p35Kt6LV5RM1n6a0XKtU/edit?usp=sharing).

This is just one data point. We'll be collecting the same information on all of our submissions periods for the forseeable future, and we'll continue to post the results.

(Speaking of which, we're opening to submissions for short stories of 1,000-4,000 words on Sunday for one week!)

Without further ado, here's what we bought last month:
