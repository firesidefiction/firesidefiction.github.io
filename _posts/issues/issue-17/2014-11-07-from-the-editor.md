Our short story this month made my skin crawl in a delightful way, as we venture the secret attic of a girl with a nasty cousin in Nino Cipri's [_Better Girls from Broken Parts_]({{ site.url }}/issue17/chapter/better-girls-from-broken-parts/). Galen Dara's art for the story is just… haunting. In flash fiction, Day Al-Mohamed spins the tale of how [_Death's Garden_]({{ site.url }}/issue17/chapter/deaths-garden/) came to be, and Eric Francis puts us side by side on deck with Captain Hook in [_The Boy_]({{ site.url }}/issue17/chapter/the-boy/). And in [Chapter Two]({{ site.url }}/issue17/chapter/she-wolf-and-cub-chapter-two/) of _She Wolf and Cub_, Abby and Geoff have escaped into the desert, but there are worse things than cacti waiting for them…
