Issue 20. Wow we've done 20 of these things? That's amazing. Fireside has been such a wonderful experience. Bringing stories into the world is a great feeling. Thanks to everyone who has helped us make that happen.  

So! Issue 20! Our first short story this month (that's right, two!) is [_To Fall, and Pause, and Fall_]({{ site.baseurl }}/issue20/chapter/to-fall-and-pause-and-fall/) by Lisa Nohealani Morton. It's a wrenching science fiction story about rebirth, risk, and our sense of self. Our second story is also our first-ever reprint: [_A Silly Love Story_]({{ site.baseurl }}/issue20/chapter/a-silly-love-story/) by Nino Cipri, a beautiful little tale of love, identity, and a poltergeist. I first read this a few years ago in Daily Science Fiction, and it's really stuck with me. I'm thrilled to share it with Fireside's readers.

In flash fiction, we have Thord D. Hedengren's [_My Name is Ronald by the Way_]({{ site.baseurl }}/issue20/chapter/my-name-is-ronald-by-the-way/), a diary of dying country, and Laura Lovic-Lindsay's [_Shoelace_]({{ site.baseurl }}/issue20/chapter/shoelace/), a tale of a little old lady who's more than a bit worrisome.

And we have [Chapter Five]({{ site.baseurl }}/issue20/chapter/she-wolf-and-cub-chapter-five/) of Lilith Saintcrow's _She Wolf and Cub_, which finds Abby and Geoff alone in the Waste with just their fourpads and the songs in Geoff's head…
