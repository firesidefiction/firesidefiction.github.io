On the train,<br  />
I taste the craggy<br  />
imperfections of my molars,<br  />
savoring the vestigial<br  />
calcifications as I would a<br  />
phoneme,<br  />
like the ones ma used to teach me:<br  />
b… b… b… baba… bälō… baba…<br  />
বাবা… বলে… বাবা |<br  />

On the train,<br  />
two children shake me<br  />
speaking a language I don’t recognize<br  />
I want to mimic their sounds<br  />
press my lips against their air<br  />
so the words breathe into my lungs<br  />
feel those vowel movements<br  />
against my jaw until<br  />
I too become<br  />
fluent<br  />
until<br  />
I too become tapestry<br  />
instead of the glued-back jar<br  />
I am<br  />

remember the elocution lessons:<br  />
অ, আ, এ, ঐ…<br  />
ô, a, e, oi…<br  />
the way your tongue swiveled<br  />
from roof to floor<br  />
a door flapping on its hinge<br  />
cawing out syllables<br  />
from the back of your throat<br  />
baby bird eager for<br  />
knowledge<br  />
eager for praise<br  />
so you could be<br  />
one of them<br  />

is that why you abandoned<br  />
অ আ ই ঈ ô a i ī<br  />
ক খ গ র kô khô gô rô<br  />
for the shelter of<br  />
a b c d<br  />

on the train<br  />
the beat of<br  /><br  />
বাংলা	Bangla<br  />
pushes the<br  /><br  />
weight of bodies<br  />
pressing in<br  />
wards urging with<br  />
out doubt with<br  /><br  />
out hesitation<br  />
with<br  />
certainty<br  />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we resist on instinct<br  />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is this where we want to go<br  />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is this the right train<br  />

passengers stare back<br  />

they do not understand<br  />

after all<br  />
why should they<br  />

I touch tongue to my molar<br  />
clinging to mother<br  />
