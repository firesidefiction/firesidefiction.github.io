Our mother tears open the moon to show us futures<br  />
when we are still wrapped in her belly, womb-warm,<br  />
nursing trust and waiting to be given shape. In sleep,<br  />
she builds us dreams, a fractal of possibilities,<br  />
a thousand upon a thousand, as branched<br  />
as our own lives still yet to be lived,<br  />
where we could be anything, anyone.<br  />
<br  />
Without fail, the end of every dream, every story,<br  />
finds you waiting with jaws wide, teeth sharp, primed<br  />
for the hunt and the chase. Proud criminal, hungry<br  />
for more than meat and blood, for more than your fair share.<br  />
We have not even met, but it is because of you and yours<br  />
that we come into this world with feet already knowing<br  />
how to run, our eyes already able to tell what is shelter<br  />
and what is safe — these are things worth knowing<br  />
truer than our own names.<br  />
<br  />
Yet there is one dream our mother saves, one<br  />
she pries free only when she is certain we are alone —<br  />
no thieving eyes, no ears to soak up secrets.<br  />
In this dreaming, she shows us a forest,<br  />
primordial and huge, massive trunks bleeding sap and water<br  />
like tears, air spiced with the scent of small things<br  />
unaware of how insignificant are their lives, snuffed out<br  />
as easily — as inevitably — as stars.<br  />
Here, paths are carved from pale light and we follow,<br  />
knowing the way is open for us and us alone.<br  />
Here we grow to greatness, here we hunt,<br  />
catch trembling bodies beneath our claws,<br  />
built to rend and water the soil with blood, an offering<br  />
from ourselves to ourselves, a gift of flesh and feasting.<br  />
Here, we will not hide.<br  />
<br  />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that soft dream of her belly,<br  />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;still formless and depthless,<br  />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we make her a promise that when we are grown,<br  />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we will dream a new story, plant a new forest,<br  />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one in which the trees do not receive you,<br  />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one in which the moon creates futures<br  />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with eyes and ears only for us.<br  />
<br  />
So, Cousin —<br  />
when we are birthed into cold air onto cold stone,<br  />
remember, before your legs grow strong enough to give chase,<br  />
before you insist upon your inheritance of earth,<br  />
wearing your confidence like barding, gaudy in your own self surety —<br  />
remember that ancient forest,<br  />
the silence of our footfalls and the shape of our claws,<br  />
remember how we stripped you down to bare bone and fear.<br  />
Remember how we took your moon from you,<br  />
hung her in the night sky, remember<br  />
how we stole the warmth from her gaze, the fire from her smile.<br  />
Remember how we made you howl.<br  />
