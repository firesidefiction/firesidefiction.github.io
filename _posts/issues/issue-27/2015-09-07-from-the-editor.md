Welcome to the final issue of Year 3! This month, we wrap up Lilith Saintcrow's serial [_She Wolf and Cub_]({{ site.baseurl }}/issue27/chapter/she-wolf-and-cub-chapter-twelve/). We have a terrific short story by Sofia Samatar, [_The Closest Thing to Animals_]({{ site.baseurl }}/issue27/chapter/the-closest-thing-to-animals/), which takes us inside a quarantined city and a search for art and friendship. There's Keffy R. M. Kehrli's [_Singing Wings_]({{ site.baseurl }}/issue27/chapter/singing-wings/), exploring how extreme change affects relationships, and John Wiswell's [_Bones at the Door_]({{ site.baseurl }}/issue27/chapter/bones-at-the-door/), which you probably shouldn't read before bed.

We also have an excerpt of our upcoming urban fantasy novel [_Take On Me]({{ site.baseurl }}/issue27/chapter/take-on-me-chapters-one-five/) by Minerva Zimmerman! It's out Oct. 6.

Thanks so much to everyone who helped make Year 3 possible. We kick off Year 4 next month. The magazine is going to be a little smaller for a while, till we get the funding higher. Please take a look at our [Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/firesidefiction) if you're not already a backer. If you are and you're enjoying Fireside, please keep telling your friends about us.

This has been an amazing ride so far. Thank you. We love you all.
