It's been a long ride to today, but here we are, starting our yearlong experiment in publishing a monthly magazine, full of great fiction with fair pay for our creators. Thanks to everyone who has helped us get to this point, most especially to all of our Kickstarter backers. You didn't let us fade away, and we can't say how grateful we are to be here.

And so, Issue 4! (We published three issues in 2012.) We have two pieces of flash fiction: a slice of backyard magic from Keffy R.M. Kehrli in [Mice]({{ site.url}}/issue4/chapter/mice/), and [The Filigreed Cage]({{ site.url}}/issue4/chapter/the-filigreed-cage/) by Krystal Claxton, a science fiction story about the price of a comfortable life. Our short story is Delilah S. Dawson's [Love Song of the Lizard Boy]({{ site.url}}/issue4/chapter/love-song-of-the-lizard-boy/), set in her Blud universe, following Eblic, who as it turns out is not quite the lazy bugger that everyone seems to think he is. And then we have the first episode of Chuck Wendig's serial, [The Forever Endeavor]({{ site.url}}/issue4/chapter/the-forever-endeavor-part-one/). I won't spoil anything. Just read it. It's going to be a hell of a ride. And finally, Year Two artist Galen Dara has produced two gorgeous images for Issue 4; you can see them on Delilah and Chuck's stories.

Thanks for reading, and if you enjoy your time with us, please tell your friends.
