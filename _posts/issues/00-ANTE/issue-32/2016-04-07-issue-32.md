For the first time in a long time, none of the stories this month are flash fiction! Don’t worry, we still love tiny stories and will have a lot more of them.

It also seems to be fairy tale month here at Fireside!

We open this month with Jordan Taylor’s [_Red as Blood, White as Snow, Black as Ebony_](/issue32/chapter/red-as-blood-white-as-snow-black-as-ebony/). She takes us into a Snow White story that has gone a bit rotten. Next up, Jennifer Campbell-Hicks returns to Fireside with [_The Memory Who Became a Girl_](/issue32/chapter/the-memory-who-became-a-girl/ ), a science-fiction story about a girl who keeps getting forgotten. And we close with another Fireside alum, A.E. Decker, whose [_Forever Now_](/issue32/chapter/forever-now/) whisks us to a magical mall to follow another lost girl.

Fireside opened to submissions again on April 1! We’ll be open to stories of up to 5,000 words through April 30, and we’re really excited to have Daniel José  Older on board as a guest editor! You can find guidelines and submission instructions at [firesidefiction.com/submissions](/submissions).

Thanks, as always, for your support, and for reading Fireside!
