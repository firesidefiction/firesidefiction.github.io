And we're back!

Sorry about disappearing for two months; we had a bunch of stuff to sort out, but we're in good shape now.

We released the second book of Minerva Zimmerman's snarky 80s vampire trilogy in December: [_Cruel Summer_](/books) is now available in most ebook stores! We also announced that we'll be releasing a story collection by Malon Edwards late this year. It will be built around the world of his Year 3 Fireside story, [_If Wishes Were Obfuscation Codes_](/issue24/chapter/if-wishes-were-obfuscation-codes/).

On to Issue 29! We have two flash pieces this month: [_Human Resources_](/issue29/chapter/human-resources/) by Erica L. Satifka, which takes us inside a twisted world of haves and have-nots, and [_Gold Farmer's Daughter_](/issue29/chapter/gold-farmers-daughter/) by Aidan Doyle, where we invite you to be a guest at a wedding inside a MMORPG. Hope you brought your sword!

We also have two short stories this month. First up is A. K. Snyder's [_All That Holds Me Together_](/issue29/chapter/all-that-holds-me-together/), an exploration of loss, grief, and tattoos. And there is Merc Fenn Wolfmoore's [_This is Not a Wardrobe Door_](/issue29/chapter/this-is-not-a-wardrobe-door/), where two worlds have been severed, and with them, a lot of friendships.

Thanks as always for supporting Fireside!
