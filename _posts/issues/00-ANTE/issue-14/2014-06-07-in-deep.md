We're down to the final two issues of Year Two! Wow, that kind of went by fast. In such a good way.

We seem to have a theme again this month, totally by accident. Our three stories this month all slide beneath the earth in one way or another. Our short story is D.B. Starler's [_Good Ghoul Gone Bad_](/issue14/chapter/good-ghoul-gone-bad/), where we meet Lola, an undead adventurer who needs some help from her ex on a most disagreeable task. It doesn't help that she wants to kill him. Galen Dara's art for the story is fantastic. (Spoiler alert: Tentacles!)

In flash fiction, David Alex Shepherd takes us to the [_Silver Hill Hotel_](/issue14/chapter/silver-hill-hotel/), where cheaters definitely do not prosper. And in [_Guard Post_](/issue14/chapter/guard-post/) by Paul O'Donohoe, we face a security system that's spoiling for a fight.

And in [Part Eleven of Chuck Wendig's _The Forever Endeavor_](/issue14/chapter/the-forever-endeavor-part-eleven/), Dale and Walt are finally together — and they're in deep shit.
