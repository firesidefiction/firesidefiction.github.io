And here we are at the end of 2013! The beginning of this year, when I had no idea what the future of Fireside was going to be, seems like a lifetime ago. But now we're five issue into Year Two! Let's dive in.

Our short story for December is [_The Gangs of Gnome Jersey_]({{ site.url}}/issue8/chapter/the-gangs-of-gnome-jersey/) by A. E. Decker. A. E. brings us to a quiet normal home in the suburbs of the Garden State. Well as normal as things can be when the owner of the house is a paranormal hitman whose roommate is a boogeyman. But things don't get _really_ strange until an uninvited guest arrives on the front lawn…

In flash fiction, we have Johann Thorsson's [_First, Bite Just a Finger_]({{ site.url}}/issue8/chapter/first-bite-just-a-finger/), a descent into a creepy new addiction, and [_Elizabeth's Pirate Army_]({{ site.url}}/issue8/chapter/elizabeths-pirate-army/) by Caroline M. Yoachim, which follows a young girl's war to save her neighborhood from an invading kraken.

And in [Part Five of _The Forever Endeavor_]({{ site.url}}/issue8/chapter/the-forever-endeavor-part-five/), Chuck Wendig takes us on a trip to the casino with Dale and the Box and a plan.

Also, if you haven't seen it, we're running a Year Two subscription drive with some prizes through Sunday the 15th. If you know anyone who might be interested, please let them know. Or, if you would like to get a subscription for someone as a gift, shoot me an email at brian@firesidemag.com. I'll get it set up for you, and you'll be entered in the drawings.

Thanks as always!
