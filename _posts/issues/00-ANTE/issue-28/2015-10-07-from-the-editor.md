Hello and welcome to Year 4 of Fireside! This is the first issue we funded under our summer subscription drive. Right now, we have enough money to bring you 6,000 words a month, about one short story and two pieces of flash fiction. We want to keep climbing toward our goal of 10,000 words a month. If you're already a Year 4 subscriber, thanks so much! If you're not, please consider going over to our Year 4 page and picking up a Year 4 subscription or backing our Patreon. And please, tell people about us and share stories that you enjoyed! It helps a lot.

This month we have flash fiction by [José Iriarte](/issue28/chapter/cupid-and-psyche-at-the-caffe-sol-y-mar/) and [JY Yang](/issue28/chapter/temporary-saints/), and a short story by Caroline Yoachim, who is making her second appearance in Fireside. (She also has a flash story coming up later in Year 4.) Caroline's story this month has a gorgeous illustration by Galen Dara.

It's been a busy month at Fireside. We accepted both flash and short story submissions in September, and we got 1,133 stories, by far the most ever in a submissions period for us! We're digging through those now to find the next few months of Year 4.

We also have our next novel out on Oct. 6, _Take On Me_ by Minerva Zimmerman. You can [visit the book's page](/books/) to find out more, read the first five chapters, and order it.

Finally, we're taking next month off from the magazine. We need to reorganize a few things, but we'll be back in December! (If you're a Patreon backer, you won't be charged next month.)

Thanks for reading!
