We're back!

Thanks for waiting while we took June off. We're organized and have a lot of stuff planned for the second half of Year 4!

We kick things off with July's issue, featuring two stories selected by guest editor Daniel José Older: [_Imagine a World So Forgiving_](/issue34/chapter/imagine-a-world-so-forgiving/) by Margaret Killjoy, a wrenching look at a reborn earth punctuated with some of the most joyously cynical lines I've had the pleasure to publish, and [_Iron Aria_](/issue34/chapter/iron-aria/) by Merc Fenn Wolfmoor, who is returning to Fireside with a gorgeous story of magic and identity. We also have [_A Place Out of Time_](/issue34/chapter/a-place-out-of-time/) by Elsa Sjunneson, a heartbreaking and beautiful story of a time traveler without many options.

Thanks as always for reading!
