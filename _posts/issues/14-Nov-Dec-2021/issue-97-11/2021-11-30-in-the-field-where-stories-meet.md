<pre>
Tell me how you fell.
Tell me
          how the edge of paradise
          slid away under your foot
          and the home you knew
          diminished.

Tell me of descent:
tell me
          how the atmosphere cried out when you entered it
tell me
          what remains in your meteorite heart.

Tell me of impact:
          tell me of pain,
          the crater that birthed you
          fragments scattered around you
          (gemstones yellow as the fire that ate you up)
say
how much of you was broken —
          more bones than you knew you had —
and how long it took to mend.

Tell me how you fell.

I will tell you how I rise.

                    I am from the ground unfolding
                    from inside dark unfolding
                    from smoking soil unfolding:
                    cotyledon
                    split
                              from an inert thing,
                              infected
                              with an urge to seek light.

                    Into the air unfolding
                    into the gem-littered field unfolding
                    the sun-clock heart of me
                              forever chasing anything
                              that falls from the sky.

                    (you)

                    I am the earth's:
                              knots and thorns
                              burls, crowns.
                    I am xylem and phloem and bark.
                    The rain that falls on me is myself.

                    I am dust, emerging and returning,
                    and I never fell.
</pre>
