Later, they said<br  />
it was the way she kept<br  />
watching the sky, the way she kept<br  />
bending to stare at the castle swans. The way<br  />
they kept finding nettles scattered<br  />
in her bed, the way<br  />
the servants saw her stealing through<br  />
the gates at night. The way<br  />
the prince had fallen in love,<br  />
so suddenly. All reasons, surely,<br  />
to send her to the stake. Not<br  />
her silence — oh no. And not<br  />
the scars on her hands. They were<br  />
quite decent people, you understand —<br  />
all of them. Even the queen,<br  />
concerned only with the safety<br  />
of son and kingdom. Even the ministers<br  />
urging death, even the crowd<br  />
cheering on the flames. Good people,<br  />
all, with good reasons, all,<br  />
to think the girl an ogre. A witch.<br  />
A monster in disguise. Not people<br  />
who would condemn a girl<br  />
with scars on her wrists, or condemn<br  />
a girl who could not speak. No. Good people.<br  />
Decent. Kindhearted, all. With good reasons<br  />
to burn a girl at the stake.<br  />

Afterwards, others crept in<br  />
to pick over the remains, saying not a word<br  />
when the white feathers and blood<br  />
clung to their bandages, their canes. And later,<br  />
when they told the tale, they said<br  />
it had a happy ending. That the king<br  />
was good, as was the queen. They were<br  />
good people, after all. Quite decent.<br  />
And good at telling tales.
