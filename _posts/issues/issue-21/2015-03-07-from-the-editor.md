And here we are, already at the halfway point of Year 3! Fireside has a lot going on. We've got [Andrea Phillips' novel _Revision_]({{ site.url }}/books/ )coming out on May 5. And we're opening to flash fiction [submissions on March 15]({{ site.url }}/submissions/) to fill out the rest of the Year 3 issues.

It's also time to start thinking about Year 4 and beyond. Year 3 is fully paid for, but our plan for this year has always been to try to make our funding more sustainable than coming to Kickstarter once a year. There may be six issues left in Year 3, but we have to start thinking about Year 4 now, so we can keep buying stories and making plans. Fireside costs about $1,500 a month to produce, almost all of which pays for stories and art. We've got a few ways you can help, [including joining us on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/firesidefiction), where we're currently taking in about $135 a month and giving out rewards like digital wallpapers, postcards, and prints of Galen Dara's monthly art. You can also set up a recurring monthly pledge (or a one-time pledge) via Paypal or Amazon [on our Support Us page]({{ site.url }}/support-us/).

Thanks, as always, for your support.

On to Issue 21!

Our short story this month is [_Zanders the Magnificent_]({{ site.url }}/issue21/chapter/zanders-the-magnificent/) by Annie Neugebauer, a dark look behind the curtain as a master illusionist is crafted by a mother with a singular focus. In flash fiction, we have Aidan Doyle's [_Pride and Profanity_]({{ site.url }}/issue21/chapter/pride-and-profanity/), which takes us into a twisted, whimsical world of words, and Rebecca Birch's [_A Taste of Cinnamon_]({{ site.url }}/issue21/chapter/a-taste-of-cinnamon/) where we follow two young teens as they explore the boundaries of their starship, and of each other. And we have [Chapter Six]({{ site.url }}/issue21/chapter/she-wolf-and-cub-chapter-six/) of Lilith Saintcrow's She Wolf and Cub, Abby is hunting for Geoff, in typical Abby fashion. She's going to start a fight…
