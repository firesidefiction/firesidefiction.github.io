There's a house on my street<br  />
where grass weasels through brick<br  />
and dandelions sprout little worlds<br  />
beside beer bottles filled with scat.<br  />
Birds stash nests with plastic in a rusted bathtub<br  />
and stray cats tryst their tails,<br  />
short-circuiting the night under a pregnant moon.<br  />
This house festers. Few walk past that don't stare, asking,<br  />
"Can wreckage ever be a good neighbor?"<br  />
Ruins like this can emerge anywhere.<br  />
Spaces once filled with worldwide signals,<br  />
piped in through the walls, surfing alongside running-hot water.<br  />
They are once-lived-in wounds that speak<br  />
with what can only fit between palms.<br  />
Crumpled. Smelt.<br  />
The house on my street was stripped and vacated in a hurry.<br  />
The owners took what they could carry.<br  />
They knew the science of rodents: everything eyed for mulch.<br  />
They left a gash so large it felt like a door to a world<br  />
tour-guided by one-eyed teddy bears with discarded cell phones<br  />
that turned ether into black noise.<br  />
The owners couldn't help but leave skins behind unattended.<br  />
Passive bakers of dust.<br  />
Sometimes, I walk down to the house<br  />
and wonder what it might take to love<br  />
a place like this. A house hunched,<br  />
the past on its back, its future in soil.<br  />
Sometimes, a spider dangles from a rotting beam,<br  />
its own chandelier, and I think, _Yes,_<br  />
_you too can siphon a statement, though I won't understand._ <br  />
_You too, stranger, are ambient._
