There's a house on my street 

where grass weasels through brick

and dandelions sprout little worlds

beside beer bottles filled with scat.  

Birds stash nests with plastic in a rusted bathtub

and stray cats tryst their tails,

short-circuiting the night under a pregnant moon. 

This house festers. Few walk past that don't stare, asking, 

"Can wreckage ever be a good neighbor?"

Ruins like this can emerge anywhere.

Spaces once filled with worldwide signals,

piped in through the walls, surfing alongside running-hot water. 

They are once-lived-in wounds that speak

with what can only fit between palms. 

Crumpled. Smelt.  

The house on my street was stripped and vacated in a hurry. 

The owners took what they could carry. 

They knew the science of rodents: everything eyed for mulch.

They left a gash so large it felt like a door to a world

tour-guided by one-eyed teddy bears with discarded cell phones

that turned ether into black noise.

The owners couldn't help but leave skins behind unattended.

Passive bakers of dust. 

Sometimes, I walk down to the house 

and wonder what it might take to love

a place like this. A house hunched, 

the past on its back, its future in soil. 

Sometimes, a spider dangles from a rotting beam,

its own chandelier, and I think, _Yes,_

_you too can siphon a statement, though I won't understand._ 

_You too, stranger, are ambient._
