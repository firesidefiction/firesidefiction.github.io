**I. Invitation**
---

<br  />**1.**<br  />
What should I say I remember<br  />
about our isolation? Shudder-<br  />
signal, silence? Your script<br  />
cycling the invitations you wrote?

You sent us loping, nearly summer-<br  />
feral, dog following, casting our neighbors<br  />
flag-emblazoned cards: Drinks, fire-<br  />
works, the metal hull of a grill—

_What should I say I remembered?_<br  />
_You held my list, snapped in a clipboard,_<br  />
_pen tethered through the hole in the clip._

_You asked if we were shopping for a spring tea,_<br  />
_toilet paper balanced against your knees._<br  />
_I lifted you from the cart so more would fit—_

**2.**<br  />
You lifted fruit from the mold so more would fit:<br  />
olives cross-sectioned, anatomies of shrimp.<br  />
Lime-based and mayonnaise-strange capsule<br  />
gelling into place. How it all cooled,<br  />

hummed into being by refrigeration. Space,<br  />
you thought, was a little like that, the way<br  />
rocketmen train for enclosure. They don't want<br  />
us, below, to see how little room they can inhabit—

_I shifted the paper towels, the antiseptic_<br  />
_bottles in our cart half-bashed and suspect_<br  />
_but all we could find. The brilliant burnt-red_

_marigolds, impatiens, cosmos frilled and pink:_<br  />
_from what was left of the low seed stock,_<br  />
_we'd shape our waiting from what we could get—_

**3.**<br  />
You shaped your waiting into a halter-<br  />
dress, a Liberty print that summer<br  />
I'd craved the way I wanted the boys'<br  />
slack-grounded wandering through July.

You'd warned me away from their cache,<br  />
whispered the ways explosions damage<br  />
bodies, buildings. You warned us<br  />
disaster happens all at once—

_You shaped your waiting into canals_<br  />
_dug through the backyard, worlds_<br  />
_Martianed and cut by the child-sized steel_

_tools we'd bought you: the garden_<br  />
_rake's bent teeth, the hoe's corrosion,_<br  />
_the shovel's splintered wooden handle—_

**4.**<br  />
The ladle's tarnished silver handle<br  />
bathed in vinegar. Hibiscus petals<br  />
adrift on the punch surface: superheated<br  />
entries or reentries? Rocketed

captains might know, or a dog (Soviet).<br  />
I pick up your small radio, tune it,<br  />
holding my breath as I pass those two<br  />
small triangles, Phobos, Deimos.

_What I began to realize I couldn't handle_<br  />
_arced around us but refused to settle._<br  />
_April-thrilled, I asked you if you thought_

_binary stars each believed the other_<br  />
_orbited it. You flung another shovel-_<br  />
_load of wet red clay agglomerate—_

**5.**<br  />
The load of wet red ground<br  />
meat you shaped and seasoned —<br  />
("Let's pretend your father did this,"<br  />
you whispered over the radio's hiss)—<br  />

He explained it to me once: CONtrol<br  />
of ELectronic RADiation. If bombs fell,<br  />
we'd hear the pattern of silence, voice, silence.<br  />
(My mother shouted, "Go greet our guests.")

_The load of wet red ground proved_<br  />
_unsuitable for the cosmos. What grew_<br  />
_contained the distances between children_

_and neighboring children. "Can we play?"_<br  />
_the boy next door asked. ("Can we," not "can they") —_<br  />
_I broke you from them, returned you to the garden._

**6.**<br  />
I broke from the guests, returned through the garden,<br  />
clutching the dog. I thought I'd broken<br  />
the radio. After I'd turned the wheel,<br  />
short silence broken by falsetto wail,

broken by silence. Instructions, Phobos,<br  />
Deimos, those twins of airless war, demigods<br  />
shouting fire over fireworks. "Seek<br  />
shelter," the voice instructed. "Under attack—"

_We broke from the world. You trenched_<br  />
_shelter in our backyard, turned over our bomb-drenched_<br  />
_concept of waiting out disaster—_

_Did I hear tornado sirens? EAS tones shrieking?_<br  />
_Instead, you huddled together over a bud, calling,_<br  />
_"Mom, come here, come over, look closer—"_

---

**II. Alert**
---

<br  />**1.**<br  />
What should I say I heard,<br  />
isolated with a thousand-Hertz<br  />
tone? The announcer apologized —<br  />
interruptions are necessary. Phased

voice from transmitters miles apart<br  />
reading the text of the local alert:<br  />
suburban north Houston or the entire Gulf Coast,<br  />
my room or the mesh of Independence Day guests—

_What should I say you heard?_<br  />
_Jump-screened, the online class you hid_<br  />
_yourself from? Kindergarten flickered,_

_aura-obscured, buffered, delayed_<br  />
_the way my voice skips during migraine,_<br  />
_skips as if the illusion of a trapped bird—_

**2.**<br  />
(Skip, Father explained, like a child<br  />
bouncing off the ionosphere, made<br  />
signals reach us that weren't ours —<br  />
like doubt, we make ours what we hear.)

"Nuclear bombs," the man said. You<br  />
wound the camera after the group<br  />
photographs: fire, fireworks. Film<br  />
exposed to radiation becomes its signal—

_We skipped class together. I withdrew_<br  />
_you from the experiment of online school._<br  />
_In shielding you from more exposure_

_to screens (or mere exposure's effect?),_<br  />
_am I teaching you what you should neglect?_<br  />
_When we hide, even families become more nuclear—_

**3.**<br  />
When I emerged, bearing the nuclear<br  />
threat on my radio, I couldn't hear<br  />
you calling over the guests for me —<br  />
"Not the Soviets, not the Chinese,"

(as if naming each threat lifted it<br  />
from possibility) — his voice, static,<br  />
mine shouting for you, reverting<br  />
("Mommy!"), his again, "No earthling—"

_Patterns emerge. I change the wording,_<br  />
_teach you not to love the flag. "Pledging_<br  />
_allegiance to the [fill in the blank]_

_shows how we love our country, one_<br  />
_nation, [indivisible as a cell's wall]."_<br  />
_I want to teach you to question the book—_

**4.**<br  />
You questioned the alert. A dance orchestra<br  />
interrupted by a Martian invasion, a drama<br  />
you'd heard before. How you loved his voice, news<br  />
bulletin read on Halloween years

before I was born. The announcer's false<br  />
calm not the despair of the dramatist's.<br  />
Once upon a time, there was a planet (Mars),<br  />
whose creatures succumbed to a virus—

_You questioned the book's perforations, crude_<br  />
_diagrams of plants, answer keys, the concept of school_<br  />
_(home or otherwise). You hid beneath_

_paintings of storm-dead trees (each season_<br  />
_a lesson in what can die) drought-blighted, diseased,_<br  />
_yard-bound and frozen, a sketch of a "vaccine"—_

**5.**<br  />
Yard-bound, I held the radio's hiss.<br  />
No shelter. From the Communists,<br  />
silence, or the fear of the signal. Flags<br  />
pinned the neighborhood together, grass

selvages edging the unsewable fall-<br  />
out shelter. As if you'd told the soil,<br  />
(belted against what flows, breaks, surfaces,<br  />
red (clay) shifts), "This is what you cannot cross—"

_Unbound, you split the day, forced its nucleus_<br  />
_outside. Cataloged the jays, the dark-eyed juncos_<br  />
_we'd fed maize and the sunflower seeds you'd found,_

_head-bound and browning. Everything becomes screen-_<br  />
_like, if not actually a screen. Glass, a hard freeze,_<br  />
_the idea of an electron, what we are able to ground—_

**6.**<br  />
Doubt: an electron run to ground. The guests<br  />
mingled, a few laughed at the nuclear bomb "test<br  />
alert" I held. Static (another explosion) background<br  />
figures arranged themselves against — sound

exploding from the street — fireworks, hands,<br  />
hands grabbing me from the uniform grass —<br  />
children's (some my blood) hands, a game<br  />
(static, crash) played to learn what will come—

_You played a structure into place. What will come_<br  />
_bound to crisis is either parasite or symbiote,_<br  />
_(possibly both). You want to talk photosynthesis,_

_solar energy, solar eclipses. Windmills and stillness._<br  />
_How the Moon pulls away from Earth, inches_<br  />
_each year like a child repelled (or repulsed?) to independence—_

---

**III. Shelter**
---

<br  />**1.**<br  />
What should I say we meant by "shelter"? Children<br  />
shelled and camouflaged, trenched, hidden-<br  />
insect tense, unmothered nestling-drab, grub-deep —<br  />
we pushed into the woods, past suburban creep,

jay-calling our way toward silence the space<br  />
hissing between radio signals couldn't place.<br  />
Our numbers young and vague, first-hatched<br  />
larvae of spring, fretting the creek's dun edge—

_What should I say you meant by "shelter"? Our home_<br  />
_stinking of us, as if we'd collected dung and bones_<br  />
_(our own?) over a year? We pushed out cracked shells,_

_tendons, entrails of time we'd consumed. Time,_<br  />
_we'd thought, clung to us, parasite-sure, fulsome —_<br  />
_time strung with a lack of what should be possible—_

**2.**<br  />
Time struck us with a lack of what should be possible:<br  />
Space breached, but not this red clay soil.<br  />
How you once told me the way wind levers<br  />
trunks of exposed trees, how storms sever<br  />

roots from tap roots. We'd make fallout<br  />
shelters from what had fallen. Hollow<br  />
trunks (toolless and toothless as we were),<br  />
hollow our bodies for what we thought was nuclear—

_Time-struck, I fell into what had once been possible,_<br  />
_("There's nothing like the taste of Blue Bell—")_<br  />
_white-ridged watermelon rinds, hammocked magnolias,_<br  />

_not the ghost-edge of ice cream you summered through_<br  />
_bending spoons (your father said to buy a scoop):_<br  />
_detail will always prove something meaningless—_

**3.**<br  />
Details proved meaningless to us. Tetrahedron:<br  />
faces pine-branched (family _Pinaceae_). Sun<br  />
quivering against the evening's carapace —<br  />
sky rocket, bottle rocket — you found us,

huddled in our dry-needle nest. Tetrahedron:<br  />
your halter dress against your collar-bone.<br  />
(After, we never pinned our patterns, aligned<br  />
ship lights, Roman candles obscured by pines—

_Details slipped from us. ("Things are changing_<br  />
_at—") Hanging the curtains I'd made, I sang_<br  />
_your names into the past ("There's more_

_for your life at—"), imagined us (as I pulled_<br  />
_shades) packed tight against the unmasked crowd,_<br  />
_firecracker tight (" —is your savings store")—_

**4.**<br  />
Firecracker tight, we made shelter: you hid<br  />
within us. How difficult it is to judge<br  />
distance, to judge how massive the craft<br  />
listing over the city (what must have

been the city) must have been. How fast<br  />
we'd made our shelter, then, trespassed,<br  />
(a fuse lit) we became shelter. We did not<br  />
need to judge the velocity of what has stopped—

_Firecrackers, tight against the evening. Fourth_<br  />
_day of a month you mark in bites. Welts soar_<br  />
_dry treetop high: flitted sparks against sodium lights_

_wake us. I try to remember summer-thrilled_<br  />
_caps, sparklers, Roman candles others held —_<br  />
_how I clutched my ears, how I clamped my eyes—_

**5.**<br  />
How I clutched my ears, how I clamped my eyes —<br  />
(What good judging the crowd's speed and size?<br  />
One ship, one spark thrown from a neighbor's<br  />
match — what good judging the pine shelter's

switch from walls to bonfire frame?) You fled<br  />
(what good judging) what the bodice of yard<br  />
held flat: a small fire in the grill you doused,<br  />
a dud firecracker your sandaled sole squelched out—

_How you clutched your sense of the world, snagged_<br  />
_evidence of now, of a possibility of now from my past —_<br  />
_how the ice cream truck passed, playing "The Music_

_Box Dancer," how the nowness of you heard_<br  />
_children (not you) baffling against the curb —_<br  />
_how you asked me to explain, again, red shift—_

**6.**<br  />
How, you asked me to explain, red shifting<br  />
guests from burning to the possibility of burning —<br  />
the space our shelter made pushed outward, bodies<br  />
accelerating apart from crises or safety from crises:

Smoke-gauze over the crinoline edge of the ship.<br  />
Later, you told me how you thought the taffeta-crisp<br  />
fracture of what had been in the woods behind the house<br  />
was you, unable to move soundlessly in a vast white dress—

_How you asked me to explain what we'd read. Shift_<br  />
_countries around your mental map like seeds left_<br  />
_unpacketed until too late. You explain the lines_

_I write, not letters but hungry animals, unplaneted._<br  />
_Dirt means nothing more than dirt. Red clay, packed_<br  />
_root-binding tight becomes an absence between rake tines—_

---

IV. Aftermath
---

What should I say _happened?_ It could have<br  />
had implications, the way fire or lack of fire can save<br  />
neighborhoods. Houses were built where pines<br  />
burned. Or trees fervor rooted to reclaim

land. No more houses were needed<br  />
than we already had. The attack seeded<br  />
military investment. Or we surrendered. The world<br  />
seam-ripped from itself. Or what you gathered—

_What should I say happened? It could._<br  />
_"After," we've yet to check off on the curriculum._<br  />
_We talk about what we'll do after the virus_<br  />

_has gone, as if the virus could read the prim-handed_<br  />
_workbook clocks stopped each on the hour. What happened_<br  />
_closes us, a chapter, a cell wall. That must, for now, for us,_<br  />
_be enough —_
