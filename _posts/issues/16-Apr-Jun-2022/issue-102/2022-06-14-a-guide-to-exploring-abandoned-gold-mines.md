Do not bring a flashlight.

In the darkness,<br  />
the earth will move beneath your feet.<br  />
Trace paths through the throat<br  />
of the world, and when it swallows —<br  />
when your feet skip a step and fall<br  />
through one eternal second of nothing —<br  />
your stomach will lurch upward<br  />
through the roof of your mouth,<br  />
through the miles of rock above,<br  />
reaching for a sky it will not find.

When you land, there will be water.<br  />
More than you expect. Drink deep.<br  />
Taste the wealth of it leaden on your tongue.<br  />
Each time your echoing steps interrupt<br  />
that holy flow of mineral blood<br  />
trickling into the deep downs,<br  />
the puddles below will growl their emptiness,<br  />
their howls will reverberate<br  />
through threads of quartz.<br  />
Why did you think we call them _veins_?<br  />
This body is eternal.

The machinery cannot run, or walk,<br  />
but it may try to speak. The rubble<br  />
will groan in your wake, the screech<br  />
of flimsy steel, the clank of broken chain,<br  />
the warble of wind through the earth's teeth.<br  />
Do not be afraid.<br  />
They have forgotten what it is to be heard,<br  />
or remembered. This is what it means to rust:<br  />
to become so warped from your purpose,<br  />
you no longer have one.

And if you brought a flashlight,<br  />
though I said you should not,<br  />
flick your wrist.<br  />
Chase away the shroud of darkness,<br  />
lay eyes upon the foundations<br  />
of your faraway reality.<br  />
Know that all of it was built here<br  />
in these granite molars<br  />
and we above are waiting<br  />
to be chewed up and spit out,<br  />
the way this mountain was,<br  />
so we too might know how it felt<br  />
to be made of gold.
