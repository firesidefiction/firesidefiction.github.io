Do not bring a flashlight. 

---

In the darkness,

the earth will move beneath your feet.

Trace paths through the throat

of the world, and when it swallows —

when your feet skip a step and fall

through one eternal second of nothing —

your stomach will lurch upward

through the roof of your mouth,

through the miles of rock above,

reaching for a sky it will not find.

---

When you land, there will be water.

More than you expect. Drink deep.

Taste the wealth of it leaden on your tongue.

Each time your echoing steps interrupt

that holy flow of mineral blood

trickling into the deep downs,

the puddles below will growl their emptiness,

their howls will reverberate

through threads of quartz.

Why did you think we call them _veins_?

This body is eternal.

---

The machinery cannot run, or walk,

but it may try to speak. The rubble

will groan in your wake, the screech

of flimsy steel, the clank of broken chain,

the warble of wind through the earth's teeth.

Do not be afraid.

They have forgotten what it is to be heard,

or remembered. This is what it means to rust:

to become so warped from your purpose,

you no longer have one.

---

And if you brought a flashlight,

though I said you should not,

flick your wrist.

Chase away the shroud of darkness,

lay eyes upon the foundations

of your faraway reality.

Know that all of it was built here

in these granite molars

and we above are waiting

to be chewed up and spit out,

the way this mountain was,

so we too might know how it felt

to be made of gold.
