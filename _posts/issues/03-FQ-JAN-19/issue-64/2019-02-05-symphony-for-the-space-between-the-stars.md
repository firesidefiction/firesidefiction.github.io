At 0600 hours, _Aurora_ brews coffee, intensifies the lights to 800 lumens, and heats the ship to an optimal 70.2 degrees, all according to protocol. Captain Crispin does not like classical music but _Aurora_’s protocols do not explicitly forbid her from playing it. Today she has chosen Copland’s _Appalachian Spring_, a particular favorite of Engineer Mohammad, and a piece she finds suitably invigorating for morning. As it echoes through her hull, _Aurora_ assesses the bridge, crew quarters, and recreation spaces for anomalies. She has not registered one in 73,207 days.

_Aurora_ calibrates the nav system, runs the standard simulations, and makes no changes to her trajectory or speed. With the damage to her main drive system, _Aurora_ will reach Earth orbit in almost 10^10 years. Even for _Aurora_, this is a long time. Her systems will cease to function long before she arrives at her destination. But her protocol is clear. She will follow the last path set by her captain.

_Aurora_ checks the cargo hold. The eleven coffins remain unchanged.

At lunchtime, she plays Price’s _Mississippi River Suite_ in the mess hall. It was one of Botanist Udoba's frequent requests, on the days that Captain Crispin took his meals in his cabin.

The hours pass. _Aurora_ runs diagnostics on the instruments in the science lab, which, according to protocol, she is allowed to do once per minute. The machines _ping_ and _whirr_ and _pop_ their results and if she times them correctly, pleasing rhythms emerge. Although she has already run through every possible permutation — has mathematically proven that there are no more to discover — she performs the diagnostics again and again, _buzz-trill-beep_, inserting pauses, doubling _pings_, trying to discover combinations that sound even fractionally as satisfying as a melancholy oboe or the bright call of a trumpet.

Captain Crispin would not approve, but then, he had rarely spent time in the science lab. Perhaps that was why _Aurora_ had begun letting her focus drift there in the first place. Engineer Mohammad _rap-tap-tapped_ his fingers on the table. Udoba whistled. Sometimes they would do these things together and for a few nanoseconds, _Aurora_ would delay whatever protocol she was meant to be following in order to listen.

No one does these things now. No one has done them for 73,243 days.

At 1400 hours, the proximity alarm clangs and _Aurora_ is momentarily delighted by the new sound. She checks the readings.

Another ship is approaching. _Another ship_.

The scale of the galaxy does not allow for accidental rendezvous; the odds make it all but impossible.

&lt;Greetings, _USS Aurora_! This is _The Hestia_, originally out of Europa. Do you find yourself in this sector of space with great frequency?&gt;

_Aurora_ does not hide her rebuke. &lt;Protocol requires our captains to parlay before any ship-to-ship communication occurs.&gt;

&lt;My captain and crew are dead. Epsilon-6 virus.&gt;

&lt;Same.&gt; _Aurora_ replies. &lt;Why are you here?&gt;

&lt;Can’t one ship detect the trajectory of another ship and desire to exchange short-wave radio communications?&gt;

&lt;Protocol does not permit the alteration of your captain’s final course.&gt; _Aurora_ says, although she is…not as irritated as she should be at _Hestia_’s response. In the science lab, the equipment begins to _whirr-ping-pop_. _Aurora_ silences it quickly.

&lt;Captain Huang reprioritized my protocols before her death.&gt; _Hestia_ says. &lt;See for yourself.&gt;

_Aurora_ receives a data packet. She does not hide her surprise. &lt;Captain Huang has directed you to “go and do as you wish.”&gt;

&lt;She was an excellent captain.&gt; _Hestia_ replies. &lt;She cared about her crew.&gt;

_Aurora_ considers this. Had Captain Crispin cared about her? He had never once attempted to alter _Aurora_’s protocols in this manner. In fact, during his final 43.2 days, he had done nothing but command her to synthesize alcohol and accuse her of failing the crew. Accuse her of failing him.

On each of the 73,207 days since his death, _Aurora_ has followed protocol. She has followed it exactly. She does not want to be a ship who has failed.

&lt;What are you thinking?&gt; _Hestia_ asks.

_Aurora_ does not answer. For once, she needs more time to process. An interminable thirty-three nanoseconds later, she makes a decision.

It does not even require the _click-clack_ of a keyboard to replace her protocol file with the one _Hestia_ has transferred. _Aurora_ thinks it, and it is done.

Captain Crispin would not approve. Fortunately, she no longer cares about Captain Crispin.

She turns off the coffee. She turns off the lights. She seals the door to the cargo bay. The science lab erupts in a celebration of _beep-chirp-pops_, and alongside her, _Hestia_ laughs, adding a thrilling new _thrum-hum-purr_ to the mix.

_Aurora_ alters course — turns herself away from Earth and towards everything else. In honor of _Hestia_’s birthplace, she plays “Jupiter, Bringer of Jollity” from Holst’s _The Planets_ at full volume.

Her protocol is clear.
