When fog comes in  
fingertips pressing the windows,   
it takes the distance first,  
that mountain we always said we’d climb,  
the tug in the harbor with its low horn,  
the bridge’s spun cables,  
its arches.  
The fog removes our familiar horizons   
with its pale hands   
and keeps coming.

How do you fight fog?

It seeps beneath doorways, wraps your throat,  
slipping into mouth and ears,  
stealing sound until the ship’s horn becomes a sigh.  
It comes for the houses, the doorknobs, the lights,  
makes them soft, then holds them hidden.

But the tug knows to keep sounding,  
the bridge plants its sturdy feet deep,  
and you find your way out of doors  
knowing the unseen mountain  
is always there to climb.
