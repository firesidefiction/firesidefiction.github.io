We raised $3,000 on the final day of the Kickstarter, including $2,000 in the last hour and $1,000 in the last 10 minutes! We are so grateful to all of our backers. You wouldn't let us fail, and so we were able to bring you this terrific issue.

We open with Elizabeth Bear's [_Form and Void_]({{ site.baseurl}}/issue3/chapter/form-and-void/), a story about a difficult friendship tested at the fringe of human exploration. Next is [_Remaker, Remaker_]({{ site.baseurl}}/issue3/chapter/remaker-remaker/) by Lucas J.W. Johnson, a look at obsession through a steampunk lens and set in a Roman Empire that never died. After that is our haunting comic, [_Famine's Shadow_]({{ site.baseurl}}/issue3/chapter/famines-shadow/), written by Rachel Deering and illustrated by Christine Larsen. Daniel Abraham follows with [_John Fisher_]({{ site.baseurl}}/issue3/chapter/john-fisher/), a story about a man, his wary stepdaughter, and an imaginary friend. And we close with Mary Robinette Kowal's [_The White Phoenix Feather: A tale of cuisine and ninjas_]({{ site.baseurl}}/issue3/chapter/the-white-phoenix-feather/). I don't think you need any more enticement to read than that subtitle, do you?

As we've been working on Issue Three, we've also been working on a plan for how to fund and publish Fireside in a longer-term, more sustainable way. We hope to have that together by the end of the year; keep an eye on [firesidefiction.com](ttp://www.firesidefiction.com)for details.

Thank you, as always, for reading.
