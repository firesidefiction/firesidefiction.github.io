I found the radio he broke.<br/>
He’d placed it in the house we burnt and abandoned;<br/>
must have returned to hide the two polaroids, after—<br/>
neatly wedged them in there and thought them safe.<br/>

I never imagined him as a child:<br/>
proudly clutching the hem of his mother’s dress,<br/>
on the other side, holding his sister’s hand.<br/>
She was just as dark and scraggy as he,<br/>
yet unlike him, unsmiling.<br/>
And though a child, she looked<br/>
aware of their poverty.

He somewhat evolved to manhood:<br/>
he held my weight on his right leg<br/>
and that of my brother on his left.<br/>
Like a river dried and a desert born,<br/>
or the loan shark who hunted on Monday —<br/>
like death, fate had caught him.

My mother said:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should have held his hand.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might have saved the house and radio.

Anyway, I found the polaroid of me as a child,<br/>
and the one he took last year at my graduation.<br/>
I wedged them in the radio and slammed it shut.
