“I opened my mouth and my mother came out.”<br/>
I hear the words but can’t comprehend<br/>
the yawning pit I feel beneath them<br/>
the self-effacing laughter<br/>
prepared to devour the unwary.

I stand at the mirror<br/>
above my bathroom sink and stare<br/>
open mouthed and waiting<br/>
on cold tile, under cold light.<br/>
I stretch my jaw cat-like, a serpent<br/>
ready to swallow my own tail,<br/>
if only I could catch it, if I only knew<br/>
where it began.

I think I catch glimpses<br/>
between strands of dark hair and darker eyes<br/>
but it’s only my reflection gazing back<br/>
in the way I think I thought you might.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Were your eyes like mine? Did you place them<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in my hollowed sockets, trading sight<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for knowledge that I would never have?)

I can almost make out your shape<br/>
locked inside the chambers of my heart,<br/>
flowing blue in narrowed veins<br/>
carrying what-if and never-was<br/>
in equal measure.<br/>
I search the whorls of my fingers and find<br/>
the only parts at once both me and mine,<br/>
the only place where I can read<br/>
a chapter in my story with all pages<br/>
intact.

When I open my skin, I find traces<br/>
in coiled loops of intestines and entrails<br/>
wrapped like an augury,<br/>
in ripples and in blood.<br/>
An open wound beside my liver and<br/>
a branch of possibilities<br/>
breathed out from my lungs.

But I don’t know the sound of you,<br/>
never learned to form air<br/>
and silence in proper sequence,<br/>
the right patterns,<br/>
the code needed to pass across<br/>
the cords and wires of my throat.<br/>
No matter how wide my mouth opens<br/>
you will never emerge<br/>
and for this I feel a stinging guilt,<br/>
as if I am at fault for being born<br/>
without a cypher to unlock<br/>
more than the name<br/>
you left me with.

I think if I could only twist<br/>
my body the right way round,<br/>
a helix in chains,<br/>
then I might somehow translate<br/>
the blank pages of the future<br/>
you coded for me in language<br/>
we never shared.<br/>
But there are only so many words<br/>
you can spell with letters A, T, C & G<br/>
and not one of those is<br/>
_mother_.
