April is looking pretty darn good. The snow is finally melting here in Boston, Andrea Phillips' Fireside novel _Revision_ got a starred review in Publisher's Weekly, and we have a really great issue to share with you.

Our short story this month is Daniel José Older's [_Stay_](({{ site.baseurl }}/issue22/chapter/stay/), which swirls through the chaos of life, love, and a hospital ER, seen through the eyes of a ghost. In flash fiction, we've got Jen R Albert's [_Katabasis_](({{ site.baseurl }}/issue22/chapter/katabasis/), which explores death at the intersection of myth and science, and Sunil Patel's [_Sally the Psychic Alligator_](({{ site.baseurl }}/issue22/chapter/sally-the-psychic-alligator/), a funny story about a scientist and her psychic alligator. Probably psychic.

We've got [Chapter Seven](({{ site.baseurl }}/issue22/chapter/she-wolf-and-cub-chapter-seven/) of Lilith Saintcrow's She Wolf and Cub. Jess and Sam are back together again, but they don't get much time to catch up…

And we also have [the first three chapters of _Revision_](({{ site.baseurl }}/issue22/chapter/revision/), so you can meet Mira and some of the other characters before the book comes out May 5.

[Our Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/firesidefiction) is up to $177 a month. When we hit $250 it'll be enough to pay for our flash fiction each month. We're hoping to get there this month, and beyond by the summer, so we can avoid doing another Kickstarter. Please check it out; there's lots of perks, many of which get you art by our fabulous illustrator, Galen Dara.

Thanks, as always.
