Peeling cocoyam with my mom one evening<br/>
in the kitchen, she put forth the question<br/>
that must have long been bothering her mind.<br/>
Steam had formed tiny beads on her face<br/>
so that it became indistinct from her sweat.<br/>
Though it was 6 pm, the sun was like<br/>
it had been in the afternoon, glorious<br/>
and warming anything in its path.<br/>
_Did you live with him like he was your wife?_<br/>
It was the question I had been dreading<br/>
for a while, knowing that one day<br/>
someone in the family would ask<br/>
about the friend I had been living with<br/>
until he died, but she had been blunt,<br/>
perhaps emboldened by the steam rising<br/>
from the pots and the strain of moving them<br/>
from one pan support to another<br/>
with her bare hands without reducing the flame.<br/>
In the short while that the blue flame rose up<br/>
as if to fondle my mother's chin,<br/>
I could see him ghosting up in the room<br/>
like something that would as soon vanish.<br/>
My sister was bringing in curry leaves<br/>
from the backyard, bleeding their perfume<br/>
in her wake as she made her way to us.<br/>
My mind was making a perfect detail<br/>
of him leaning against the cabinet,<br/>
more present to me than my sister was,<br/>
perhaps also waiting for an answer.<br/>
Alas, my mother was ready to discard<br/>
the years of upbringing she must have thought<br/>
she had instilled in me and my siblings,<br/>
ready to discard years of self-anguish<br/>
at what I might have become â€” might in the sense<br/>
that she still strongly believed I could change.<br/>
It must have hurt to have not received<br/>
any reply from me, in my old way<br/>
of pretending that I had not heard her<br/>
and washing the leaves like they needed<br/>
the thorough washing I was giving them.<br/>
But more hurt by the truth that my silence<br/>
was subtly telling, and consoled by it,<br/>
the uncertainty that my silence bore,<br/>
masking the brunt of her disappointment.<br/>
