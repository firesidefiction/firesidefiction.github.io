Welcome to Issue 18!

We've got a terrific collection of tales for you this month. Our short story is Rebecca M. Latimer's [_All Manner of Men and Monsters_]({{ site.url }}/issue18/chapter/all-manner-of-men-and-monsters/) (illustrated by Galen Dara), taking us inside a family where the father is angry, the mother is locked in a tower, and the son is confused. Oh, and the father is also a dragon …

Our flash stories this month are Hope Erica Schultz's [_Mr. Reilly's Tattoo_]({{ site.url }}/issue18/chapter/mr-reillys-tattoo/), where love is inked forever into skin, and Robert Lowell Russell's [_Twenty Parsecs East of the Earth Bypass, Closed on Sundays_]({{ site.url }}/issue18/chapter/twenty-parsecs-east-of-the-earth-bypass-closed-on-sundays/), where we meet some tourists from waaaayyy out of town.

And in [Chapter Three]({{ site.url }}/issue18/chapter/she-wolf-and-cub-chapter-three/) of Lilith Saintcrow's _She Wolf and Cub_, Abby and Geoff have found a place to catch their breath … but not for long.
