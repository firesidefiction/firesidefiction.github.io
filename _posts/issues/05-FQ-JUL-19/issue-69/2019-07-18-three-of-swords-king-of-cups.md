Sometimes, I put my heart<br/>
in a mason jar, cover it with herbs<br/>
wrap the glass in lights,<br/>
and let it shine<br/>
in the dark.

I leave it offerings:<br/>
honey, a bit of wine, a circle of salt<br/>
to keep it safe, but not pristine —<br/>
there’s nothing neat<br/>
about what’s sacred,<br/>
so I revel in the mess,<br/>
the uneven beat,<br/>
the way it speaks<br/>
without being spoken to.

There were years I buried it,<br/>
others where I banished it,<br/>
tried to drown it,<br/>
resented it for its wideness,<br/>
its wildness, the stubborn way<br/>
it refused to shatter, but thrived<br/>
to bend.

I have given it away, ripe<br/>
like fruit, frayed as a stray<br/>
wind, a creature of dancing<br/>
and daring, a thick mess<br/>
of uncompromising clockwork.

Sometimes, it comes back ragged,<br/>
worn down or atrophied,<br/>
tender from overuse,<br/>
howling, but it only needs<br/>
to be reminded of its own worth,<br/>
encased in glass<br/>
and glimmer, reawakened<br/>
to its own song —<br/>
there is no spell<br/>
more powerful than that.
