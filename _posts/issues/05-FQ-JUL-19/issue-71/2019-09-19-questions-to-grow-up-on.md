<div class="questions">

<div class="right">
you call yourself caribbean?
<br/>your skin’s too light, your name
<br/>too asian
<br/>you did not know the island life
<br/>you do not know our lands
<br/>what do you share with us, of the pains
<br/>of our ancestors
<br/>of the slavery that built our island
<br/>you know our food but not our culture
<br/>not our language
<br/>how can you talk of the islands when
<br/>you were born in the land
<br/>of ice and snow</div>

<div class="left">
what asian are you?
<br/>can you call yourself chinese
<br/>when your tongue has forgotten the
<br/>language of your ancestors, faded
<br/>into the barest of phrases in
<br/>a dialect spoken only in a
<br/>tiny village unchanged
<br/>for centuries
<br/>until the world came to it
<br/>and stepped on its grounds
<br/>tore down the old homes
<br/>and built the same suburban house
<br/>like any other colonial house
</div>

<div class="center text-center">
that’s all you know
<br/>that’s all you’ve ever known
</div>

<div class="right">your black blood got lost so long ago
<br/>that you only look Less Pure and
<br/>unrecognizable to your chinese brethren</div>

<div class="left">
the tongues of your ancestors squashed by
<br/>the standard chinese that’s
<br/>foreign to you, unrecognizable
</div>

<div class="right">you abandoned the name
<br/>that marks your island heritage</div>

<div class="left">you chose a name in that tongue
<br/>not spoken by your people</div>

<div class="left quarter">to be accepted into a group</div>

<div class="right quarter">that sees you as an other</div>

<div class="center drop">how do you reclaim a name you never used?
<br/>memorized like lines of a drawing
<br/>in unpracticed scrawl
<br/>and an untrained tongue</div>

<div class="center">they call your parents practically white
<br/>because their English is good and unaccented</div>

<div class="center text-center">but you’re too foreign to be white
<br/>too white to be asian
<br/>too asian to be black</div>

<div class="center">“Are you an Asian? You’re basically white –
<br/>can barely pronounce your own goddamn
<br/>name.”</div>

<div class="center">“Nah, you can’t be Jamaican. You ain’t
<br/>Black.”</div>

</div>
