Dear Reader,

Thanks so much for coming to sit a spell by the fire with us. This is our very first print quarterly issue and we’re thrilled to share it with you. We’ve got an awesome selection of stories and essays, some from returning _Fireside_ authors like Innocent Chizaram Ilo and Courtney Floyd, and some debuts from new voices like Alexandra Rowland and Christopher R. Alonso.

In 2018, Team Fireside, like the rest of the world, has been thinking a lot about sexual harassment and rape culture, so it’s natural that some of those thoughts are reflected in our contents for this issue. We have stories that examine issues of consent and agency like “Carborundum > Dev/Null” by Annalee Flower Horne and “The Ceremony” by Mari Ness, and two essays by survivors who are processing the #MeToo movement from different perspectives: “#MeToo, and Furthermore” by Hillary Monahan (which I edited), and “Who Gets to Say #MeToo” by Ace Ratcliff (which Elsa edited). These aren’t the first essays we’ve published about this topic, and they won’t be the last. There’s a lot to take in around this conversation, and we’re committed to cultivating productive dialogue and healthy community standards.

We’ve included content notes for the pieces that discuss these difficult topics in ways that might be triggering, and we hope that as you come to this issue, you will practice self-care and be gentle with yourself. Step away if you need to. Hard conversations are often worth having, but we want you to be able to choose to enter them willingly and not be inadvertently triggered. I’m a survivor myself, so this is personal for me, too. 

Not everything in this issue is difficult, of course. Alexandra Rowland’s “Love in Every Stitch” pairs nicely with the third essay we have for you, which is about knitting and resistance. Elsa proposed and edited this one, and I love it. I love the power of softness and gentleness, and the celebration of the ways in which cozy domesticity can been subversive and empowering.

We’ve also got some stories of hope and healing for people like the ace protagonist in “A Taxonomy of Hurts” by Kate Dollarhyde and the grieving grandchild in “To This You Cling with Jagged Fingernails” by Beth Cato. We have stories of defiance and strength like “The Story of a Young Woman” by Ose Utomi and “By Stone, By Sea, By Flower, By Thorn” by Sarah Goslee, we have stories about siblings whose bonds last beyond mortal lifespans like “Pigeons” by Nibedita Sen, and “Friday Night Games” by Anne Dafeta, and we have some stories that are just a lot of fun like “How to Identify an Alien Shark” by Beth Goder.

Our artists have knocked it out of the park for this issue as well. Charis Loke, Kevin Tong, and Michelle Wong have all given us beautiful illustrations. And of course I can’t possibly end this without also recognizing the beautiful design work Pablo has done to bring this first print quarterly issue into the world as a gorgeous object. I hope you love it as much as I do.

All Best,
Julia Rios, Fiction Editor
