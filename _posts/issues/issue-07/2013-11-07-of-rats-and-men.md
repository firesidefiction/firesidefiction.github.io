It feels like the last few months have flown by; it's hard to believe we're already on the fourth issue of Year Two!

We've got another great mix of stories this month. Our short story is [_Catch a Fallen Star_]({{ site.baseurl}}/issue7/chapter/catch-a-fallen-star/) by Jennifer Campbell-Hicks. She takes us to a planet whose orbit takes it through an asteroid belt twice a year, forcing the populace underground. But the action in Catch a Fallen Star takes place on the surface, with meteors streaking overhead and a veteran "rat catcher" in pursuit of a 16-year-old boy "slum rat." And they both have something to prove.

For flash fiction this month, we have John F. Gardner's [_The Last Good Day_]({{ site.baseurl}}//issue7/chapter/the-last-good-day/)<br/>
, about a man's grim way of providing for his wife after he dies, and Sam Gorenstein's [_Sure I am Metaphysically Sinking Into a More Terrifying Universe, but We All Have Our Things to Deal With_]({{ site.baseurl}}/issue7/chapter/sure-i-am-metaphysically-sinking-into-a-more-terrifying-universe-but-we-all-have-our-things-to-deal-with/), which will probably always hold our record for longest title on a story.

[In Part Four of _The Forever Endeavor_]({{ site.baseurl}}/issue7/chapter/the-forever-endeavor-part-four/), Chuck Wendig pulls back the curtain a little on Dale's world, but that just leads to a lot more questions…

Galen Dara has created more more wonderful art this month—two pieces in fact, one for _Catch a Fallen Star_, and one for _The Forever Endeavor_.

Also, a bit of capitalism. [We've opened a store on Zazzle](http://www.zazzle.com/firesidefictionco?rf=238456961614688862) with T-shirts, mugs, and tote bags featuring two versions of the Fireside logo. There are tons of style and color options.

And finally, [we also have opened a Tumblr](http://firesidefiction.tumblr.com/), if you're on there.

Thanks, as always!
