I was thinking today of a<br  />
world without traffic lights<br  />
where pushing the button<br  />
on the dashboard for recirculated air<br  />
would send the carbon dioxide<br  />
we breathe out from the cabin<br  />
into a special compartment full<br  />
of plants and the compartment would<br  />
be open to let in the sun but<br  />
shielded to protect it from wind and<br  />
the plants would photosynthesize<br  />
the carbon dioxide and release<br  />
oxygen that would be piped back<br  />
into the car, which, come to think of it,<br  />
would probably be solar powered<br  />
and in the world where<br  />
this car exists there would be<br  />
a skyscraper where all the people<br  />
live, high up in the clouds,<br  />
and everywhere else would be<br  />
parks.
