I was thinking today of a

world without traffic lights

where pushing the button

on the dashboard for recirculated air

would send the carbon dioxide

we breathe out from the cabin

into a special compartment full

of plants and the compartment would

be open to let in the sun but

shielded to protect it from wind and

the plants would photosynthesize

the carbon dioxide and release

oxygen that would be piped back

into the car, which, come to think of it,

would probably be solar powered

and in the world where

this car exists there would be

a skyscraper where all the people

live, high up in the clouds,

and everywhere else would be

parks.
