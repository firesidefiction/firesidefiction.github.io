_Airborne birds_: easiest, still impossible. fly<br/>
up and out, pump your wings hard<br/>
until the air thins into blazing light<br/>
in the darkness. panoramic view of<br/>
the junkyard below is not to be<br/>
missed.

_Lampreys_: feed on diseased<br/>
blood, food, and scientific fodder<br/>
for the stars, until you explode. your pieces will<br/>
cycle carbon, nitrogen, water, rock,<br/>
for eternity.

_Fire salamanders_: the fire isnâ€™t real until you find<br/>
one. your plume of ashes is visible from<br/>
the space station.

_Shrews_: dig down until the pressure<br/>
caves tunnels. curl your venom<br/>
into a ball to be distilled into<br/>
diamond. wait.

_Humans_: others first, then us. blast cliffs for<br/>
diamonds until no fingerholds remain<br/>
unharvested. fall.
