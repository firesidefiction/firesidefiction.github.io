It's October, and that means Halloween. This wasn't exactly planned, but this month's issue goes pretty well with the favorite holiday of every ghoul, sprite, and demon.

Our short story this month is full of costumes and masks, but not on trick or treaters. In [_Sell it Like Death]({{ site.baseurl}}/issue6/chapter/sell-it-like-death/), James McGee takes us inside the world of lower-tier pro wrestling, where there are lots of dreamers, especially Ryan "The Rage" Rollins. This story has really stuck with me since I bought it last year. I wouldn't have guessed a wrestling story would grab me this way, but that's one of the things I love about doing Fireside, the surprises I get outside the genres I usually have my head in. Galen Dara has done her usual fantastic job with the art for Sell it Like Death.

We have two very different pieces of supernatural flash fiction this month. In R.D. Sullivan's [_Skinned Knees_]({{ site.baseurl}}/issue6/chapter/skinned-knees/), a woman pieces together a life she never thought she'd have. And in Melissa Mead's [_Downstairs, Upstairs_]({{ site.baseurl}}/issue6/chapter/downstairs-upstairs/), we get a workaday look at life in Hell.

And finally, there is [[_The Forever Endeavor: Part Three_]({{ site.baseurl}}/issue6/chapter/the-forever-endeavor-part-three/). Dale is starting to get ideas…
