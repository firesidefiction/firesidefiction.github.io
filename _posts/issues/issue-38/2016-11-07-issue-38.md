Welcome to Issue 38! This month we open with an aching little ghost story by Fireside alum Caroline Yoachim, [_Paperclips and Memories and Things That Won’t Be Missed_]({{ site.url }}/issue38/chapter/21/). Next up is [_Sometimes the Crossroads Come to You_]({{ site.url }}/issue38/chapter/23/), a terrific time-travel story from Mikki Kendall. And finally there is another story that guest editor Daniel José Older selected, [_Dragon Soap_]({{ site.url }}/issue38/chapter/25/) by M.K. Hutchins. It’s a gorgeous trip into the swamp, both the humid kind and the human kind.
We’re taking next month off, so we will see you again in January! Thanks as always for reading!
