And now, finally, Year 3 has begun! We have a completely redesigned, free website. (Thanks so much to Pablo Defendini for his beautiful work.) [We have a variety of ways for people to support us](/support-us/) as we work to move away from Kickstarting to a more sustainable model. We are opening up again to [submissions](/submissions/) in a few days. And, of course, we have Issue 16 to kick off Year 3.

Our short story this month is [_Testimony_](/issue16/chapter/testimony/) by Jennifer Mason-Black. This one's a gut-twister, set in a future that has passed a very sick little girl by while she lay frozen, awaiting a cure. In flash fiction, we have [_The Work_](/issue16/chapter/the-work/) by Alexandre Stone, a race against time as the walls come down, and [_The Cutting Yield_](/issue16/chapter/the-cutting-yield/) by Hillary Jacques, a story about food and family in a shattered future.

And we kick off our serial by Lilith Saintcrow: _She Wolf and Cub_. This month's issue features a [prologue](/issue16/chapter/she-wolf-and-cub-prologue/), which readers may recognize as the story _Maternal Type_ from Issue 9, as well as [Chapter One](/issue16/chapter/she-wolf-and-cub-chapter-one/).

Thanks so much to all our readers and our supporters. And tell your friends and fellow readers they can now read Fireside for free!
