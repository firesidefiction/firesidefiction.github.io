Welcome to the 25th issue of Fireside! We've got just two issues left in Year 3, and a little over a week to go in our Year 4 subscription drive! Please check it out and spread the word. We need your help to keep publishing great fiction and paying writers well for another year. If you've already  supported Year 4, thanks!

We've got two stories looking at what you might do with a little magic amid the end of the world. There's Helena Bell's [_Look Upon my Works, Ye Mighty, and Despair (In Three Months)_](/issue25/chapter/look-upon-my-works-ye-mighty-and-despair-in-three-months/), set in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. And Lauren Roy's [The Eleventh Hour](/issue25/chapter/the-eleventh-hour/) asks what you might do with a little extra time before it all falls apart. We also have [_A Clockwork Heart_](/issue25/chapter/a-clockwork-heart/), which is a follow-up to Lucas J.W. Johnson's Roman steampunk story _Remaker Remaker_ in Issue 3. And in [Chapter Ten](/issue25/chapter/she-wolf-and-cub-chapter-ten/) of Lilith Saintcrow's _She Wolf and Cub_, Abby, Geoff, and Sam are sent reeling just as they reach what seemed like safety…
