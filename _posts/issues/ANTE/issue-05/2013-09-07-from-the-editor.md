One of the best things about editing Fireside has been working with so many talented people. And it's always great to see those people get recognition they deserve, like Ken Liu and Galen Dara did last week at the Hugo Awards. Ken, whose story [_The Journal_]({{ site.url}}/issue5/chapter/the-journal/) is in this month's issue, won the Hugo for best short story for _Mono No Aware_. Galen, whose illustration this month is with Ken's story, won the Hugo for best fan artist. Congratulations to both of them, and to all the other Hugo winners.

We've got a lot more talent in Issue 5, too. We usually have two pieces of flash fiction, but this month we have a bonus third story for you! There's Sandra Odell's [_Listening to it Rain_]({{ site.url}}/issue5/chapter/listening-to-it-rain/), a love story that finds more than one way to be unorthodox. There's Jake Kerr's [_Looking for Bad Guys_]({{ site.url}}/issue5/chapter/looking-for-bad-guys/), which is somehow sweet and sad in the same bite. And there's Andrea Speed's [_The Last Job_]({{ site.url}}/issue5/chapter/the-last-job/), in which the cops are the least of a bank-robbing crew's worries.

And, of course, there's [Part Two of Chuck Wendig's _The Forever Endeavor_]({{ site.url}}/issue5/chapter/the-forever-endeavor-part-two/ ). Dale pushed the button. Maybe Chuck will tell you what happened.

While we've been working on Issue 5, we've also been trying to get better set up on social media. We've long had a [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/firesidefiction), but we're now also on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/115383669414125397073/posts) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FiresideFiction), so if you're on any of those, come say hello!

Enjoy Issue 5. Tell your friends. And, as always, thank you for reading.
