We’re in the home stretch to the end of Year 4! How did that happen already?

We continue to hear a lot of good response to our [\\#BlackSpecFic report](https://medium.com/fireside-fiction-company/blackspecfic-571c00033717#.mu0so6wxm). We’ll talk about that more  later this month, but for now, make sure you check out the new [black speculative fiction magazine Fiyah](http://www.fiyahlitmag.com/).

We’ll also be kicking off our Year 5 drive soon; keep an eye out for that.

On to the issue! We have three terrific stories this month, opening with the return of Malon Edwards to Fireside, with his creepy techo-zombie story [_Delta Child_](/issue36/chapter/delta-child/).  Then we have another Fireside alum, Sarah Gailey, with her story [_Homesick_](/issue36/chapter/homesick/), a sci fi horror piece about longing and regret. And then we have a great story selected by guest editor Daniel José Older, [_Emergency Management Protocol_](/issue36/chapter/emergency-management-protocol/) by C. C. S. Ryan. It’s a disaster story. It’s a breakup story. It’s a great story.

Thanks, as always, for reading!
