Welcome to Issue 24!

We have two short stories this month: Malon Edwards' [_If Wishes Were Obfuscation Codes_](/issue24/chapter/if-wishes-were-obfuscation-codes/), a cyberpunk ride with a cop named Doré, and Alex Hughes' [_Fluffy Harbinger of Death_](/issue24/chapter/fluffy-harbinger-of-death/), where we meet Myss, a harpy… in a chicken costume. Our flash fiction this month is Jeff Xilon's [_All of Our Days_](/issue24/chapter/all-of-our-days/), which takes us into the head of Tyrone on his last day in a physical body. And in [Chapter Nine](/issue24/chapter/she-wolf-and-cub-chapter-nine/) of Lilith Saintcrow's _She Wolf and Cub_, Abby, Geoff, and Sam have finally moved out of the desert. But the Vines don't seem much more hospitable…
