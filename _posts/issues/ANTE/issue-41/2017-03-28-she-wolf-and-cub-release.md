I saw Logan yesterday, and hot damn, that movie shares a lot of DNA with this book. If you liked Logan, I think you'll like She Wolf and Cub.

**About the book**

![She Wolf and Cub cover](/images/book-covers/she-wolf-and-cub-small.jpg)

Ever since they gave her a new cyborg body and a steady stream of murderous work, she’s known the rules. Keep your head down, do your job, don’t get involved.

Then they sent her to assassinate a child.

Instead, she took him out of the City and into the Waste. Of course they’ll be coming for her, and for the strange, quiet, thirsty boy she’s rescued. Because he’s not just a child — he’s a profitable experiment. Bounty hunters. Fellow cyborgs. Cannibals. Monsters. They’re all after him. All she has on her side is an almost-invulnerable body, a lifetime’s worth of stubbornness, and the willingness to kill whoever she has to.

It’s going to have to be enough.
