Welcome to the first issue of the new-style Fireside. It’s not all that different than the old style, except we’ll be using the ebooks (attached here for Patrons) to collect the previous month’s stories and nonfiction from [our new website](http://firesidefiction.com/), where we’re now posting a few times a week instead of all in one swoop each month!

This month’s issue has three pieces: “The Revolution, Brought to You by Nike,” a fantastic story about fighting fascism with marketing and culture by Andrea Phillips. Andrea also wrote us an essay, “The Revolution Was Televised,” which examines the bones of her story and its roots in the Philippines’ People Power revolution, which she lived through. And finally, I wrote an editorial, “This Machine Kills Fascists,” about our new mission.

One final note: In an effort to reduce duplicate postings in people’s inboxes, we’ll be using Patreon messages just to fulfill rewards like the ebooks and wallpapers. If you’d like to get weekly updates about what we’ve published and news like the opening of fiction submisson periods, you can [sign up for our newsletter here](http://eepurl.com/cC-qf5).
