Welcome to Issue 30. We've had a great month at Fireside, reaching our Year 4 survival goal with time to spare! Thank you so much to everyone. There's still time to spread the word as we work to hit our stretch goals by Feb. 5 to add more words to each issue and to hire Daniel José Older as a guest editor.

On to the stories!

We open with a really tough but important one: [_When He First Laid Eyes_](/issue30/chapter/when-first-he-laid-eyes/) by Rachael K. Jones. It's about stalking and harassment of women, and it's powerful. Next is Effie Seiberg's [_Re: Little Miss Apocalypse Playset_](/issue30/chapter/re-little-miss-apocalypse-playset/), a fun romp through a corporate email chain. And we close with [_Fairy Tales are for White People_](/issue30/chapter/fairy-tales-are-for-white-people/) by Melissa Yuan-Innes, which takes us inside Guangdong Barbecue in Toronto, where a debt has come due.

Thanks for reading, and as always, for supporting Fireside!
