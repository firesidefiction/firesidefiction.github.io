And here we are, at the end of Year 2. Thank you, again, to everyone who has made this possible, the Kickstarter backers, the new subscribers, the writers. Thank you to Galen Dara for the wonderful art that has brought every issue to life. Thank you to Pablo Defendini and Kirk Biglione for building our beautiful website. Thank you to our families and our friends. Thank you, most of all, to my wife, Lauren, without whose support, advice, and love Fireside wouldn't be possible.

We're going to take a month off to do a little work on the website, edit the stories we're buying from our submissions period in June, and get Year 3 in shape. We'll be back on Sept. 1, on a new schedule of publishing the first Monday of each month. Lilith Saintcrow's serial is already written, and man, are we looking forward to getting started on that.

But! In the meantime, we have Issue 15, the finale of Year 2. Our short story is [_Sun Tea_](/issue15/chapter/sun-tea/) by M. Bennardo, the tale of a minor league pitcher who has brewed up a surefire path into stardom. In flash fiction, we have Megan Grey's [_Missing_](/issue15/chapter/missing/), a haunting trip into a memory, and James Darrow's [_Reversal_](/issue15/chapter/reversal/), where a man gets a chance to fix his last, fatal mistake. And, in [Part 12 of _The Forever Endeavor_](/issue15/chapter/the-forever-endeavor-part-twelve/), Chuck Wendig ties off fate's threads for Dale, Walt, and even Dave …

Thank you for reading.
