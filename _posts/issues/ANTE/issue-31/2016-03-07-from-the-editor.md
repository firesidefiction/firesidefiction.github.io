Welcome to Issue 31!

Our first story this month is a bit of a trick, as Sarah Goslee didn't tell me till after we bought [_The Kingfisher Manifesto_](/issue31/chapter/the-kingfisher-manifesto/) that the story is entirely true! So much for Fireside _Fiction_. But it's a wonderful story, and it captures the spirit that Fireside is chasing so, so well.

After that we have Edward Ashton's [_The Bird_](/issue31/chapter/the-bird/ ), another avian piece, but this one firmly grounded in fiction as we take a trip through the multiverse.

We close with Sarah Gailey's [_Haunted_](/issue31/chapter/haunted/). When we take submissions, we get a lot of haunted house stories told from the point of view of the house. Usually, they don't work. This one, though. Oh, this one is perfect.

We hope you enjoy, and thanks, as always, for supporting Fireside.
