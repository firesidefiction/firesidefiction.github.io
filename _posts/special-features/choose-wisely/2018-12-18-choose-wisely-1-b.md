Great! There’s an online version of the form to replace the paperwork. You just need to remember your password. This should be easy.

It would be except your last password had to contain seven characters, a wingding, and the recipe for spotted newt, and you can’t remember whether you used your grandmother’s recipe or your great-grandfather’s.

You request a new password. The website cackles at you and calls you names, but lets you do it. Finally, you download the form. It needs to be signed by a doctor.

No, not the doctor you’re seeing tomorrow, the other one, farther away.

Doctors don’t take emails, or talk through mirrors, or accept chiropteran deliveries. They all use an antiquated technology called a facsimile machine (fax), which requires that you also have a fax, or know someone who does, or an app that mimics a fax on your phone (unlike an mirror or email, which does exactly the same thing, you think, grumpily). You sip your coffee.

Your nerves are feeling a bit jangled.

You need a printer to make a paper copy of the thing you’ll need to fax. Or you’ll need to pay for the app’s secure fax service. (Which doesn’t do anything much different than an email, and actually you highly suspect it is email software glamoured with a cheap fax spell.)

Do you:

A. [Print and fax the document](/choose-wisely-2-a)?

B. [Download the app](/choose-wisely-2-b)?
