Here's a post showing how to add author information into a page. Add a block like the ones below for each author, adn fill in the values for each parameter (img, name, url, and bio). Add author images to the new images/avatars/ folder in the repository. If the author doesn't provide an image, that's fine, just don't include the 'img' parameter.

{% include author.html
            img="avatars/rdsullivan.jpg"

            bio="R. D. Sullivan lives in Northern California with her family and two very bad dogs, where she runs a subcontracting business. Beyond fiction, she likes to spend her time performing stand-up and producing short films. R.D.’s grandmother would like you that all of R.D.’s talent comes from her."

With patience, sensitive equipment, and ample provisions, you can sometimes glimpse Allison at allisonmulder.wordpress.com.

Courtney Floyd spent the first twenty-four years of her life living on the borders of the underworld, where she learned to write in between tarantula turf wars and apocalyptic dust storms. She now lives in Oregon with her husband, her hellhound, and an ancient cat whose skeleton she plans to articulate when it passes on to that great big paper bag in the sky. When she’s not writing fiction, she’s working on her Ph.D. dissertation or teaching college freshmen how to write argumentative essays.

When she isn't torturing characters, you'll find her cooking, baking, running, cycling and spending time with her family.
