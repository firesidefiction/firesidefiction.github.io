### Description

This is a test, not a real book.

### Reviews

"Saintcrow’s writing is sharp and poignant.... Longtime fantasy readers will enjoy Saintcrow’s take on the magic-tinged bildungsroman."

—[Publishers Weekly](https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-9987783-6-5)

"Lilith Saintcrow has given us a story of growing up, finding love, and discovering magic for the first time ... this coming-of-age tale is as genuine as it is magical."
