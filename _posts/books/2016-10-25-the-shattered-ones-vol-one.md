### Description

Turning someone you don’t know into a vampire probably violates the Hippocratic oath. But Alex wasn’t really thinking about that when he found a girl bleeding out in his shower. Being turned into a vampire isn’t as awesome as it sounds. Especially when all Hannah wanted to be was dead. She thought she had finally escaped her brother. Until she woke up. Alive? Undead? Whatever. And now Hannah is stuck with the uncoolest vampire in existence. _The Shattered Ones, Volume One_ collects three novels: [_Take On Me_](take-on-me), [_Cruel Summer_](cruel-summer), and [_Running Down a Dream_](running-down-a-dream), the complete first arc of the series.
