author-bio: |
  Lili Saintcrow was born in New Mexico (which probably explains everything, given the nuclear testing) and spent her childhood bouncing around the world as a military brat. She fell in love with writing in second grade and has done it obsessively ever since. She currently resides in the rainy Pacific Northwest with her children, dogs, cat, and assorted other strays, including a metric ton of books holding her house together.

### Description

Dez Thompson’s family—now without their domineering patriarch—is busy creating a new life on Wyoming’s plains. To Dez, magic hides in the grass, and especially in the wind—and she is about to find out that magic is real, bloody, and on the hunt for the perfect victims.

### Reviews

"Saintcrow’s writing is sharp and poignant.... Longtime fantasy readers will enjoy Saintcrow’s take on the magic-tinged bildungsroman."
