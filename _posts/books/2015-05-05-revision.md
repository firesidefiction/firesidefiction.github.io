### Description

Mira is a trust fund baby playing at making it on her own as a Brooklyn barista. When Benji, her tech startup boyfriend, dumps her out of the blue, she decides a little revenge vandalism is in order. Mira updates his entry on Verity, Benji’s Wikipedia-style news aggregator, to say the two have become engaged. Hours later, he shows up at her place with an engagement ring. Chalk it up to coincidence, right?

Soon after, Benji’s long-vanished co-founder Chandra shows up asking for Mira’s help. She claims Verity can nudge unlikely events into really happening — even change someone’s mind. And Chandra insists that Verity — and Mira’s newly minted fiance — can’t be trusted.

### Reviews
"Tremendously enjoyable, Revision is a fluid, flexible, wonderfully dextrous debut, and I can't wait to see what Phillips does next."
— NPR

“Phillips poses hard questions about love, loyalty, personal identity, and truth, and her answers range from fascinating to horrifying...her fresh voice will be very welcome in the SF world.”
