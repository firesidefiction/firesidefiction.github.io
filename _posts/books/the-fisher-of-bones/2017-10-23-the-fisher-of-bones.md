### Description

The Prophet is dead.

Ducky isn't ready. Ducky doesn't have a choice. Ducky doesn't even have a name anymore. The Prophet has been called home by the Gods, and the eyes of the Gods have turned to his daughter. They whisper in her ear, now. For a generation, her people have been following ancient instructions, carved on bone in a language only the Prophet can read, toward the Promised Land. Now their journey is almost over. And whatever lies between them and the place they will call Home—be it deserts, legendary horrors, or the monsters men make of themselves—it is Ducky's burden to take them there. It is her blessing to take them there. Even if it costs her everything.The Prophet is dead. Long live the Prophetess.
