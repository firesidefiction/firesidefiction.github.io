### Description

It’s been four years since Hannah and Alex fled Chicago and made a new home in Atlanta. Alex is in love with Hannah, but he’s vowed not to complicate her life any further. So she’s doing all the normal things a twenty-something vampire is supposed to do: dating, holding down a job, fighting with her superhuman family. The Braeburns don’t make anything easy. Neither does Gabriel, a spy who wants something Hannah won’t give up. The tension is thicker than the Georgia summer air, but that will have to wait. There are enemies, old and new, just over the horizon, and one of them is named Zachariah.
