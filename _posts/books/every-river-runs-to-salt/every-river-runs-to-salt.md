# Every River Runs to Salt
By Rachael K. Jones

**Part 1: Pacific**

I keep an ocean in a jar on my nightstand and a handful of coffee beans in my pocket. My roommate Imani once held the Pacific Ocean hostage in our living room, but that was before she died and I followed her down to the Under-Ath to fix the mess she left.

If anyone wants to smart off about how I'm spouting nonsense because the Atlantic and Pacific run together, and all oceans are ultimately one and the same, tell that to the American Lobster. Throw one in a tank and drive across the continent and toss it into the foreign salt, and you just see whether it circumnavigates the tip of Argentina like a lonely Magellan hellbent on finding home, or if it floats belly-up and kisses the setting sun goodbye.

Imani decided to steal the Pacific Ocean because she knew nobody could stop her. She wasn't wrong about that. Right after Summer Break, she flew in from California with darkness in her eyes and a Mason jar of sandy water. She grunted out a _hi_ and beelined for her bedroom the moment she got to our place at Steeplechase Apartments. I trailed behind her, trying to salvage some sense of homecoming.

"And how was San Francisco?"

"Sunny. Peaceful. Utterly wretched." Imani flattened out a green napkin on the windowsill and set the sloshing jar on top. Tiny pink seashells no bigger than apple seeds bobbed and swished inside the water.

"Sounds pretty great to me. You know how many chigger bites I got?" I'd spent the summer at the Okefenokee Swamp, tagging migratory herons for my field study biology class.

"That's the problem, Quietly. It _is_ great, but nobody notices. Californians are like palm trees. Overgrown bushes on stilts, heads so far in the clouds they miss what's happening right around their ankles."

I'd never met anyone in the world like Imani. She claimed to be part glacier on her mom's side —not a demigod or nature spirit, but something caught in between, and more dangerous because of it. All raw power but no schooling, like a tiger cub raised by house cats. I wouldn't have believed her, except Imani trailed weirdness behind her like a jet stream.

I sidled up so close her elbow jabbed me in the stomach while she sketched something on the napkin. I squinted at the lettering through my glasses. "Tell me that's not a hex." Last time I'd seen Imani so angry, she'd swapped a man's thumbs with his big toes, and never undid it, least to my knowledge.

"It's out in the sea, just floating there. They all know about it. They've even named it, like it's some kind of _pet."_ Imani arranged some larger shells on the napkin around the spell and gave the jar a swirl.

"What the _hell_ you talking about?"

"The Great Pacific Garbage Patch. A whole continent of litter swirled together offshore. It's thirty years old, Quietly. _Thirty years._ It was born before we were."

"Is that ocean water?" I screwed off the lid and dipped in my pinky finger. It tasted like distance and old wisdom and sixty-two different languages, most of them extinct. It flushed my thoughts round and round. I might've gotten fall-down drunk if Imani's anger hadn't sobered me up. It was crackling static rage, all quick precision and sharp retort.

"Careful. That's a whole ocean in there."

"Ain't a whole ocean in that dinky little jar." I didn't believe her, even after tasting it. I'm Quietly, after all. Not _Gullibly_ or _Foolishly._

She bit some extra growth off her thumbnail and spat it in and screwed the lid back on. "There will be. Just you wait."

"For real?" This was supposed to be homecoming night, where we popped kettle corn and split a bottle of wine and watched the BBC version of _Pride and Prejudice_ until sunup, but instead Imani was starting to scare me. "That sounds… well, kind of evil, don't it?"

Her eyes glittered and laughed. "If they miss it, I'll know they deserved it to begin with."

Glaciers are stubborn things. They freeze and melt and freeze again, and their hearts don't change quickly, if ever. But when they do, they're set in their ways for a long time. Imani's conviction ran much deeper than I could follow, all the way to the ocean floor.

----

We did end up having the kettle corn and TV marathon, but Imani drank three quarters of the wine and ducked out long before sunup. I had to watch Colin Firth debase himself on my lonesome. I couldn't even enjoy it, because I kept dozing off and dreaming in sixty-two languages, my head all spinning, spinning, spinning, like my brain could flush down the world's waste by sucking it all in.

By morning, Imani's theft was all over the news. The clip I remember best is a woebegone surfer perched on what used to be a wave but was now just a lump of sand, rocking his hips back and forth so the surfboard scooted along like a tricycle with the brakes on. Imani drank a whole pot of tea and giggled through hours of live footage, pleased as a tabby in the cream.

That left it to me to be the responsible one.

"Okay. You've had your fun, but it's not funny anymore." It really _was_ funny, but it didn't do to egg on anyone with glacier blood. You might just deepen their convictions. I bit my cheek bloody to tamp down the twitchy little grin. "You going to give it back now?"

She batted me away with her tealess hand. "Not yet. They've barely noticed the garbage. It's all just sitting there, if they'll only walk out far enough to see."

"Well, that's just asinine." Whatever Imani said, you notice when a whole ocean goes missing, especially if you're an ocean liner or a dolphin. I thought she would feel guilty about the dolphins at least, but she kept cycling through YouTube and swirling that jar on her knee, that poor helpless ocean deprived of its coasts. "Don't worry, Quietly. Let me have my bit of fun. I'll put everything back just as tidy as you please, dolphins and all."

"If you promise," I said doubtfully.

When you lose somebody you love, you spend a lot of time looking in your mental rearview mirror, trying to pinpoint the moment it could've turned out different. I've come round and round to that instant, her grin spread wide and the jar on her knee. When she scratched her braids, white flaky dandruff caked her nails. Her voice sounded exactly like January, all dead brown grass and fragile newborn resolutions.

Maybe in that moment I could've changed the course of what came next. If I'd declared it Zombie Apocalypse night, and shut off the internet and power, and staged an intimate two-person D&D campaign by candlelight. Or maybe it was already too late by then, and the Pacific was already exacting its slow, relentless revenge, turning all her bones into salt.

----

Imani's family story about the glacier begins in what would someday be Nigeria back in the BC times, when an Igbo woman set her sights on a promising star as evening fell. She paddled her canoe after it for days and days. The wind blew cold and the water froze, and eventually she arrived in Antarctica.

That's where she met her glacier, all huge and blue beneath the long polar night. It had never met a woman before. It dolled itself up in the Southern Lights just for her, a glacier's idea of wedding clothes. I guess it got the wrong impression when the Igbo woman tied up her canoe and spent the night with it.

Imani's great-grand struck a fire for warmth. It's hard to keep flames going on a glacier without proper setup, because the meltwater wants to rush over the embers, smothering it to ash.

But the glacier loved her. It opened tiny channels in its ice to leech the water off. As the long night wore on and the fire burned, the woman sank deeper and deeper into the ice. To the glacier, this felt like the heat of love burning into its secret heart until finally the fire and woman _were_ its heart, its center of gravity.

So the smitten glacier spoke to her.

"What would make you happiest, Love?" (Imani always pitches her voice high and feminine when she speaks the glacier's lines, so that's how I tell it.)

"To sail after that star until I find it," said the Igbo woman.

"Then let me be your canoe," said the glacier.

They chased the star until the horizon bent and took them in circles, so they never arrived and stayed together always.

Somewhere in all that, Imani claims the woman and the glacier settled down and had a few kids, which was how the world got Imani several generations later. I have no earthly idea how woman-on-glacier action might've worked, and no, I won't imagine it for you. I'm inclined toward skepticism on that point, except Imani exists. I don't know how else to explain how she could trap a whole ocean in a jar, or hex men who piss her off, or any of the other weird stuff she did.

I suppose it's no weirder than any other myth. At least it's consensual, which is more than we can say about Zeus.

----

I should've held Imani to her promise to return the ocean —I _know_ that now, in retrospect —but she did it during Drop/Add Week, which screwed with my mojo. I'd enrolled in forty hours of class, which is twenty-two past the maximum allowed. You could get away with that during Drop/Add. They always made me drop most of them, but for a few days, I had my fun.

My master plan was to stay in college forever by carefully failing to meet the requirements of any particular degree. I was one class away from successfully matriculating from two dozen different majors. I mainly did it to collect syllabi. I like syllabi. They're terribly optimistic. Slap a date next to anything and it almost becomes possible.

Imani should've been in class during Drop/Add week, but I never saw her. I caught her slinking home so late you could rightly call it early. She had the look of fever-dreams on her sweat-slicked skin, like ocean floor volcanoes boiling in the deep.

"You didn't go to class today," I observed, waving her to the free spot on the couch. She didn't deny it, just flopped beside me, leaned her sweaty head on my shoulder, and blew all the air from her lungs.

"Too dangerous. If I set one toe on campus, I'll have the Oconee River to reckon with, and I'm not strong enough for that. It's fighting me every second now, even in my sleep. Oceans don't want to stay inside jars." She squished a kidney-shaped pillow against her chest and burrowed into the cushions.

The Pacific Ocean was currently holding down my stack of 15 new syllabi on the living room floor, keeping them neat from the ceiling fan's ravages. I sheepishly moved the jar back to the coffee table. "With a name like _Pacific_, you'd expect it to give you a good night's sleep."

Imani groaned, threw the kidney pillow at me. Syllabi scattered around my feet, optimistic ticker tape. "Har har. Funny, but wrong."

"Nuh uh. It means 'nonviolent.' Peace-loving."

Imani flicked on her phone, and pretty soon I heard her YouTube playlist going. "The Pacific's got war in its heart. It's rotten all the way down, and anyone who says different is a liar. It's the garbage patch, the gyre pulling everything away from the shore. Out of sight, out of mind, out of memory. You float on peace while all your troubles swirl round and round, out where you don't have to see them."

She showed me her phone screen, an aerial view of her theft. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch sans Pacific. A plastic apocalypse heaped over vague ocean-shapes, corals and reefs and shit. Ever seen kudzu smother a forest to death? Like that, but shrink-wrapped.

"Imani, listen. This don't seem fun anymore, right? How about you just put it back now?"

Imani plopped the pillow in my lap and lay her head there. I smoothed back her dreads from her bloodshot eyes. I never loved her so much as right then. Perfect compassion and perfect anger dangled on the scales of her wisdom. When she flexed her biceps, she left a dent in history. There were men and women aplenty in the world, but only one Imani.

"Quietly, listen: Athens is a gyre too. There's a basement of sorts. An underneath. This part —_our_ Athens —just floats on top."

"An Under-Ath?"

"No, really. I've been there. Don't you wonder where I'm keeping all the extra water?"

"It's not in the jar?" I picked it up. The Pacific roared forlornly and smacked against the glass.

Imani touched my hand. My heart flip-flopped like those beached Californian dolphins. Her tired eyes crinkled into a warm smile. "You believed that? God, you're silly sometimes, Quietly. You can't fit the whole ocean in a jar that small."

I stuck my tongue at her, because otherwise I might've had to kiss her. I caught her gazing back, the same look writ large on her eyelids. I leaned into the warm halo of her, her dark wet glacier-eyes, her chapped lips. So close her breath fogged up my glasses. I hardly dared to breathe.

Then the doorbell rang, and it all went deeper South than Athens.

We jerked apart. I set down the jar and made to answer it, but Imani wrapped my wrist in cold fingers. "Please. Just let it be?"

She had a point. At dark-thirty the only people who ring your doorbell are drunks and cops. But with thwarted-kiss awkwardness hanging in the air, I welcomed the distraction. "I'll just look through the peephole," I assured her.

It wasn't a drunk or a cop. On our doorstep stood the State of California. He'd dyed every part of himself a different color than what came natural. Bleach-blond hair, orange-gold tan, and white, white teeth that outshone the porchlight. Broken shell necklace and absolutely no shirt, I swear to God. If I had abs like that, I wouldn't cover them neither. Of course, what works out West doesn’t necessarily fly in Athens. All the mosquitoes in Georgia were having a party on his pecs, and him trying to stay suave through all his slapping and scratching.

"Who is it?" Imani had shadowed me to the entryway. I let her have the peephole. "Shit. Don't answer."

We slouched against the door shoulder to shoulder. Outside, our visitor slapped at mosquitoes and crushed tenderhearted porchlight moths beneath his Chacos.

"He's going to kill me!" Imani hissed.

"Well, do you blame him? You stole his ocean!"

She made doleful hound dog eyes at me. "God, Quietly, help me and I swear I'll be indebted to you forever and always. I'll even buy next time we hit Creature Comforts."

"How generous. You going to put back the damn ocean now?"

Imani pursed her lips. "Yes," she said slowly, "but it won't be instant. I have to fetch it back from the Under-Ath. They don't exactly like me down there."

She looked so tired and scared right then. It pricked my heart something awful.

"Just go get some sleep," I said. "I'll keep watch. He has to go away soon." That was a lie. I didn't know if he'd ever go. But Imani rubbed her arms and stood on shaky faun legs and retreated to her bedroom and shut the door.

When her light clicked off, I answered the doorbell. "Ring it again and you can meet my shotgun," I told California. "I call it Bingo." I didn't really have a shotgun —I'm vegetarian —but in Georgia the Second Amendment is practically a sacrament, so it could've been true.

He held up his hands, golden with sand in the cuticles. "Whoa. Chill out, babe. I'm just looking for our ocean." He craned his neck around the door. "I think I can smell it in there."

I took a sniff, but only caught stale weed and Old Spice. "I don't know what the hell you're talking about." I made to slam the door, but he wedged in a Chaco.

"Not cool, man."

_"Excuse me."_ Like my grandmother, I could make _excuse me_ sound like _fuck you_. "A: I'm a lady. B: it's two in the morning. Come back at a decent hour, thankyouverymuch."

California didn't take his damn foot from the door, but he stopped trying to bodycheck me. "Whoa, hey, it's cool. I don't want anything from you. I just have a little gift, something for the woman who holds the Pacific Ocean in her hands."

He smiled freshwater pearls at me, the white shiny kind they farm by force-feeding sand to oysters. It gave me the all-over shivers. "Imani don't want your gifts."

"Let me tell you something about the Pacific," and here he leaned in so close I could see his hair roots, how flaky brine stiffened his tawny locks. "One taste, and it gets its hooks into you. For the rest of your life you'll crave it like oxygen. The gift of yearning. That's what I leave to the thief who stole our bride."

In that instant, I wished Bingo existed outside my fantasies so I could chase that prick off my doorstep. "I know some curses too," I told California. "_Bless your heart_." I slammed the door in his face.

I slept sentinel against the door that night, unwilling to go to bed lest he Here's-Johnny’d his way in. I nodded off into nightmares of an inverted Athens full of bad jazz and decaf coffee. Imani kissed me in exactly zero dreams that night.

Somewhere around 4am, the light flicked on under the door in Imani's room.

----

Worry kept me awake most of the night, so I overslept and missed class entirely. When I finally woke, Imani was doing watercolors at the table in the kitchen nook, painting right on the back of my Intermediate Medical Terminology syllabus. She strung her finished art on a string that ran the length of the apartment. The papers had gone all wobbly from the damp. I couldn't make heads or tails of them. None actually pictured anything but water-stained blankness.

I leaned over her shoulder, puzzling over the wet colorless swirls. "Is this a Bob Ross thing? Wet-on-wet?"

Imani scratched her scalp. Dried brine powdered her nails and sprinkled onto the invisible landscape. "Watercolors. Minus the colors." She dipped her paintbrush into an open Mason jar of sandy water, held the brush to her lips for a moment, fixing to lick it. Just froze like that, considering it like triple chocolate birthday cake.

"Shit, Imani. Please tell me that's not the Pacific." I flicked on my phone and checked for news, but nobody had reported the surf's return.

She painted trembling ocean swirls on the syllabus. "I meant to free it, but couldn't stop thinking about it. Didn't sleep last night. Just cradled it to my chest, wondering how it would taste, all cold and briny and sunshine-kissed."

I swiped the Mason jar lid from the counter and screwed the Pacific Ocean closed again. "Alright, Imani. This isn't going to work. We don't sit around all day painting with other people's oceans." Imani growled at me, actually _growled_ like a hound dog, so I bopped her on the nose with a rolled-up syllabus. "Quit that. You've been hexed." I told her all about California's visit, about the gift of yearning, and especially how I'd yelled him off our doorstep.

Imani whistled low and clapped me on the shoulder. "You're getting Loudly in your old age, Quietly."

"You're a bad influence. So, thoughts on anti-hexing you?"

Imani yawned so hard her jaw popped. "I'm thinking we didn't sleep last night and we need coffee before battle-planning."

"Downtown then?"

She was already lacing up her boots. "Nothing better to flight the blergs."

Imani yawned too much on the walk over, that stupid glass jar cradled to her breast. I hoped Downtown's hum and buzz would jog us awake. Broad Street is like Mister Roger's Neighborhood if every third building were a coffee shop, and every fourth a bar.

I dragged Imani straight to Jittery Joe's for a strong-brewed Wake n' Bake with a splash of almond milk and settled her on a barstool facing the street.

"Now. Let's talk about our battle plan." I unfolded a cardboard coffee sleeve and clicked open my pen. "You know any counter-curses? Antidotes? Arcane glacier shit?"

Imani drank down her coffee all thirsty-like, heedless of its heat. "They shouldn't've been able to find me this far away. What assholes."

"They shouldn't've been able to curse you at all. We're under the protection of the University," I said. First rule of Athens: you don't mess with its students. The University goes back far enough to have its own kind of protective magic. "I say we appeal to them first. They're responsible for us."

She popped off the lid and upturned the cup to get the last few drops. I passed her my nearly untouched coffee, and she gulped it down too. She licked her lips and clattered restless fingernails against the Mason jar.

"Hot damn. You were running on empty."

"I don't trust the University. They work for the Oconee River, and we all know where that leads," Imani muttered.

I quirked an eyebrow. "To the Atlantic?"

Her eyes caught fire inside. _"Exactly."_

"Imani? That was sarcasm."

Imani cut her eyes at me. "The Oconee's a tattletale. I'm not brave enough to see what my home ocean might do if it caught me with the Pacific on my breath. It can't possibly be anything good or right or safe."

"How about just giving California the ocean back?"

Her eyes wandered back to the jar on the table. "I know I should. I tried last night, and… well, I couldn't."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

Imani swirled the jar gently between her fingers. Where it caught the light, ocean waves danced on the coffee shop wall. "I asked it to go home, but it knew I wasn't being sincere. I have no power without approaching the magic with my heart in my hands and my spirit boiling over. I… I think I'm in love with the Pacific, Quietly."

If I didn't already know Imani's story about the family glacier, I probably would've laughed in her face. But I could see how a part-glacier woman cursed with yearning might feel something like love for an ocean. How something in her nature would look into the waves and find the shape of a soulmate. It gave me a sick squirmy feeling in the pit of my stomach I couldn't name. I suddenly wished she'd never set foot in California.

I stacked our empty cups together. "You're going to have to let it go, Imani. The Pacific don't belong to you. It definitely don't belong in Athens."

"There's another problem. Like I said, I tried to undo the spell last night. I went down into the Under-Ath." Her voice got teeny-tiny. I had to lean in to hear her, forehead to forehead so our hair made a ropey cave. "I found something down there. Something ugly and dangerous. This city's bones are steeped in death, Quietly. It dragged its skirts through blood, then dumped the evidence in the Under-Ath so nobody would have to think about it."

I held my breath. She'd rattled me. "What did you see?"

Imani shook her head. Her dreads knocked soft against my cheeks. "It tried to keep me and shelve me with the rest of its curios, but I got away."

"But not the Pacific." Underneath the fear, I felt a bit annoyed. Everyone kept making things needlessly complex. That's where lies and deceit always lead, I suppose.

"Technically it's still there. They can't control the Pacific, not without the Pacific's say-so." But there was doubt in her voice.

"If most of the Pacific is stuck in the Under-Ath and refusing to leave, how are we supposed to appease California?"

She rested her chin on the Mason jar and shook her head, knocking loose a brine shower. The salt had crawled one-third down her scalp. "I was thinking I could just drink it all down. Maybe that'll break the spell."

"People die from drinking salt water," I pointed out. "Your cells will shrink and your blood vessels will narrow and your heart won't be able to pump your blood fast enough to bail out all that salt in time."

"It can't be that bad," said Imani. "Not any worse than this. Can't seem to quench this thirst, Quietly. Not even with Wake 'n Bake."

"We haven't tried Terrapin yet," I pointed out. Athens beer could wash away a lot of hurts.

"You're not listening."

"Am too. You're not yourself. It's just this curse."

Imani stared at me, _through_ me, into that secret stash of wisdom she almost never shared. "He called it a gift. I bet that's the loophole, the reason he slipped through the University's protection. He can't curse us. That would just rebound. It's got to be something he would wish on himself." Bright, heavy tears crowded her eyes until a few escaped, trailing brine in their wake. "God. He must miss his ocean something powerful."

"Well, I'm not ready to give up," I said.

But I wasn't so sure anymore.

----

I was throwing away our empty cups when the bell jangled over the front door and a woman in damp red flannel almost bowled me down. She wore a sock printed with Big Foots on her right hand and threw the other arm around my shoulders like a sloppy drunk.

"Sorry, buddy. Didn't see you. Hey, question. Seen any oceans around lately?" she asked.

I wiggled out from her armpit. Her mildewy flannel sleeve dragged against my cheek like an unwanted kiss. Weed and stale coffee smell smeared my Nickel Creek T-shirt.

"Who the hell are you?" I demanded.

Imani sat bolt upright, rabbit-eyed and alert. She slithered from her seat with the jar and ninja'ed along the wall toward the exit behind me.

"I'm Oregon." Her voice sounded like young, proud mountains full of wolves. I hated her instantly.

"Great. We have your ocean right here." On an impulse, I spun around to take the jar from Imani, but it was like depriving a lifelong smoker of their last nicotine patch. Imani held the jar like a football and body-checked me with her hip. I bear-hugged her, reaching toward the jar, but her arms were longer. After an awkward scuffle, Imani broke away and charged outside and down the street. I followed after, Oregon tailing us.

Oregon shouted something at us. Turned out her voice really was full of wolves. A whole pack tumbled from her mouth onto the sidewalk and howled. Huge fir trees broke through the pavement and crashed through parked cars. The whole street sloped up, up, and up to a convex horizon, and a deep volcanic growl tumbled from its apex.

"Hold up," said Oregon, her socked hand resting on the biggest wolf. "You're not leaving with that ocean."

"We're trying give it back," I said. "California just made things worse. We need more time." All around us, firs towered higher and shattered holes in the sidewalks and buildings. The townies wouldn't stand for that. If it went on too long, it could mean war.

"You've had plenty of time already. More warning than you gave us." Warlike ferns curled around my feet and ripped at my ankles. I ground them down with my heels.

At the Georgia Theater, a street musician opened his guitar case and strummed a chord. The air thrummed with Athens-ness, jazz and blues and 90's grunge, the city asserting its name. A strong wind shook the towering firs. I tap-danced between the sudden pine cone hail. The wolves stalked forward, leisurely and deliberate.

But Imani stood stock-still, that jar locked against her chest. "You're yearning for it too." Secret deep ocean creatures crawled behind her pupils. "Tell me: if you love it, why did you hurt it so bad?"

"We never hurt our ocean." Oregon sounded a little defensive. "We loved it."

Imani cradled the jar like a sick child. "Yes, you did. It told me everything."

The holes in the sidewalk snicked shut, snapping the firs at their roots. They crashed sidelong into the beautiful brownstone storefronts, shattering glass and scattering amethysts on the street. The wolves bunched up and whimpered, their ears and tails flattened out.

"That was a long time ago," said Oregon. The broken glass pushed back, forcing out the trunks, patching itself together again.

"Give it up," I said. "You can't beat us here." Athens loved its own, if you found a way of belonging.

The firs zipped back into her pockets one by one. She took a deep, endless breath. All those wolves howled up inside Oregon's lungs again. "Let me tell you something about the Pacific. Fill your lungs with it just once, and all your responsibilities will dissolve, and you'll waltz drunken circles with the surf in your arms. Try this on for size: the gift of abandon."

I don't know what to expect from a curse like that, but it doubled Imani over like a stomach punch. The jar tumbled from her hands and rolled in the gutter. I swiped the jar before Oregon got any ideas, but she'd disappeared, leaving only the Big Foot sock behind.

I helped Imani up by her elbow. "You okay?"

She looked lopsided, like when you're drunk and even your standstill sways a little. "I don't know. I feel sort of... good?"

Imani took a woozy step. She shuffled along the gutter like a tightrope walker, gradually widening the steps, a gorgeous little shimmy in her hips.

I stopped to collect Oregon's sock. Imani took a bigger step and spun on her heel.

It was a waltz, sloppy and precarious, but true to music only Imani heard. One-two-three one-two-three, heel turn, big step, about face, around and around.

Imani waltzed sandy steps on the sidewalk all the way to Steeplechase. I couldn't get her to talk to me. Maybe she couldn't hear me over the music in her head. At home she shut herself into her room and turned up the radio full blast. Happy music, manic rave music. The walls thrummed and the floorboards shook beneath her stamping feet, the sound of a woman dancing herself to death.

----

I tried pounding on the door, but Imani wouldn't open it, no matter how much I begged and threatened. I ran out to Avid Bookshop for a whole stack of books on curses, and spent the evening alone reading them.  Foot-track magic and stable witches, evil eyes and tombs and sports teams. Nothing to act against this Pacific hex, not that I could find.

I had another sleepless night, and not just because the pounding backbeat shook our shared bedroom wall. I could sleep through any sticky hot Georgian night where your armpits soaked the bed sheets and a heroic fan pushed the listless air in circles around your feet. But a cold front blew through Steeplechase that night, an ocean wind sucking up all human moisture and carrying it out to sea.

I got out of bed at 4am and found Imani slumped in the living room corner, her legs still kicking beneath her. I tried to put her to bed, but even lying down, her feet danced on air. I pulled the blanket and sheet up, kissed her forehead, and prayed she'd catch a few winks.

Unsettled, I went for a stroll, rounding Steeplechase to where the Oconee Greenway lapped against our backdoor. Say what you will about the Oconee River: it has none of the Pacific's martial nature. The Oconee rolls soft as a guest too polite to take the last cornbread square. Even its name dissembles. Oconee: _The land beside the water_. Oconee River: The water beside the land beside the water. Something Biblical about that, like a powerful woman named for her husband. Eve's daughters. Lot's wife. Oconee, Oconee.

"Morning, Oconee."

It muttered back to me beneath the drooping myrtle branches. . _Quietly, quietly._

I held up the sock. "They keep hexing Imani. Can't you do anything about it?" But the Oconee just burbled away in the half-dawn. I was about to chuck it in, give the river a taste of any lingering magic, when someone spoke behind me.

"Hold up. You using that?"

A man had crept up from the R.E.M. Steeple's long black shadow, a smelly wet man with too much beard and no umbrella, and the windblown hair of hardcore cyclists and men's deodorant models. He wore a Birkenstock on his left foot and a Big Foot sock on the right that exactly matched the one I'd been about to hurl into the Oconee.

I fought the urge to scream forever, then scream some more, then transform into an ever-screaming roadside attraction.

The State of Washington had found me.

I threw the sock at him. It slapped wetly against his chest. "This stops now. Y'all need to pack up and go back where you came from, else I'm gonna march back into my apartment and pour that ocean down the drain."

He half-flinched, half-sneered like when you're about to deliver a zinger but instead swallow a mosquito.

"I don't want to hear another fucking word. What's your deal, anyway? Gods? Ghosts? Only dead things have ghosts. Last I checked you're just missing the ocean you use for your toilet bowl."

Washington picked up the sock. "Call us Hypotheticals. We exist when there's a job to do." He hopped on one foot and slid the sock over his Birkenstock. "We're almost done, though."

"I don't want to hear it. Y'all are killing her. She hasn't slept. She's in there right now, dancing herself to death." I hocked and made sure it included lots of snot. "Gift of abandon, my ass."

"I'm sorry, but I've got a job to finish. I exist, after all." He sounded full of genuine regret, or else my bullshit meter was broke. Then he started pedaling on air. A cycle ghosted in: first the spokes, then the handlebars, then the cherry-red frame. "Let me tell you something about the Pacific. One taste, and you'll lie down by its shore and dream forever of the most carefree time in your life. I leave your thief the gift of peace." Now he was pedaling so fast it was just lunging and retreating Big Foots, and the bike began to rise.

The sweet Oconee finally lost its temper and attacked the high bank, gobbling down the earth where Washington had stood seconds before. He rang a little copper bell and flew into the westward shadows. Far east, sunrise's pink ribbon pushed at the horizon.

I bolted back to the apartment, kicking myself for leaving. The radio had stopped.

"Imani?" I knocked softly on her bedroom door, afraid to wake her if she'd dozed off. She didn't answer. I knocked again, harder.

I gave it to the count of ten, then cracked the door. An Imani-shaped lump bunched up the blankets.

I needed to see her breath rise and fall just once before I could let out the one I was holding. I approached her bed by inches. The jar spooned against her side like an elderly cat. I lost all pretense and shook her arm.

Her shoulder crumbled beneath my touch. I pulled the blanket back. No Imani. Just the pile of salt that was her corpse.

I didn't notice until later —after the police, the questions, the sobbing calls to my mom —that the jar on the floor was bone dry and empty. Not even a grain of sand stuck to its threads.

**Part 2: Oconee**

Set aside oceans for a moment and forget. Step into the woods and forget. Take a long, deep draft of muscadine wine and forget about the pillar of salt that was Imani, the best friend I ever had, my crush-cut-short. Forget about vengeful Pacific Hypotheticals, their yearning, their abandon, their backstabbing peace.

Just forget.

Muscadine season in Georgia sneaks up on you edgewise between summer and winter. Outside the South most people haven't ever heard of a muscadine, even though their fancy French table wine grows grafted on its roots. That's a metaphor for America, if you will. You can hunt them in the woods in September by their scent. You never smelled anything like a muscadine. You have to bite down hard to get through their tough purple skins, and if you eat too many, their acid chafes your lips raw.

Wild muscadines grew along the Oconee Greenway behind Steeplechase Apartments. They're all I ate the week of Imani's funeral. I couldn't stand to be in the apartment with all that salt. It piled on the bed and carpet, tracked down the hallway by everyone who tried to move it. Imani's aunt from Macon filled the whole coffin, but the pile didn't get one whit smaller. I had a nasty row with the landlord over it, but he wouldn't let me out of my lease early.

The night before the funeral, I got waking nightmares about the cursed salt-corpse and the hundred blank watercolors strung back and forth across my apartment's ceilings. My itching feet took me down to the Oconee, where the muscadines dropped by handfuls from their heavy vines twining down the drooping myrtle branches. I gorged on them and spat the seeds into the Oconee.

"She's gone," I told the Oconee. "You know the worst part? You don't get any grieving days when you're just a roommate. Nobody expects you to be hurting so bad you can't even get up in the morning for Intermediate Medical Terminology. _She was just your roommate,_ they'll say. Why does it hurt so bad?"

I'd brought a snitch of her salt in a jar so the river could taste the emptiness. I let the water slip the jar from my fingers, and it floated half-sunk in the muddy shallows like an unrequited love. The Oconee bubbled up and brushed my toes through my Crocs. That gentle river-kiss crumpled my last defenses. I sobbed into the Oconee so hard. I'm not ashamed of it. Somebody should pity you when you're hurting, and sometimes there's nobody but yourself to do it proper.

The Oconee carried my tears south and east until it joined the Altamaha River, and then flowed into the Atlantic, and so my small sadness was taken up into the Atlantic's broken heart. It was the kindest thing anyone did for me.

The Mason jar floated half-full of water back to shore. I tried to pour it out, but the Oconee clung inside, defying gravity.

I finally understood. "You want to come with me." The crushing loneliness lifted a little. I screwed on the lid and wondered whether rivers grieved too. If they got a little lonely, forever rushing past everyone who touched them.

Sooner or later, every river runs to salt, too.

----

That might've been the end of all of it had the University not given me straight A's to compensate me for my grief, and in doing so nearly got me killed.

I had a weekend off from class after they buried Imani, so I packed a can of coffee beans and a can of Terrapin beer and made for the Oconee Hill Cemetery to appease her ghost.

The cemetery was as old as death in Athens. You could picnic on the crumbling headstones of all the rich old white men they'd named all the streets and buildings after. College deans and judges and Confederate government heads. They cast good shade, anyway.

Imani was buried in the new section across a sketchy iron bridge built in 1899. They'd tamped down the dirt since the funeral and pulled a blanket of sod up over the gentle hump remaining. No headstone yet.

I lay down beside the hump and breathed deep the smell of wet earth and bruised grass. Remembered the last happy moment, that almost-kiss on the couch before the doorbell rang. "I miss you, Imani. I missed you when you went to San Francisco, too. I never told you how much." I stayed there a long while, dozing in the chilly autumn sun until a shadow fell over my face, severing the warmth.

I opened my eyes and stared up at the shiny oiled abs of California.

What kind of Hypothetical kills your roommate then shows his face in broad Athens daylight just feet from where you buried her yesterday?

"Fuck you," I told him, brushing away the grass clippings stuck to my cheek. "You already won. Go home. What else could y'all possibly want from me?"

"We want our ocean back." That unhurried West Coast drawl set my teeth on edge. He reeked of sweat and coconut oil.

"It's gone, _dude._ You made Imani drink it with your damn hexes. What the hell's your problem?" I swung to my feet, settling my backpack strap on my shoulder. The triple weight of coffee and beer and river slapped the small of my back. No time to leave them now.

"Wrong. It's not _all_ gone." California sized me up like a Baptist with a gospel tract. Then he _sniffed_ me. "There. You've tasted it, haven't you?"

Getting sniffed broke every one of my personal space rules. I danced backward up Imani's dirt-hump, wrinkling the loose sod. "The _hell?_ Do I _look_ like someone who's ever been west of Texas?"

"You were the last, except Imani." He had enough shame to cast his eyes down at her name, that bastard. "But one taste is plenty. In you lives the Pacific on its last day. It's enough."

Grief-sharpened memory flashed me back to the day of the hex, a finger dipped in a salty jar, the fall-down intoxication of sixty-two languages, most of them extinct. Yes, I'd tasted the Pacific. Not that I'd admit it to that asshole California. "You want me to spit in a cup or something?"

He wrinkled his nose. "No way, man. Nothing like that. We'd just fly you west, lie you down in the sandy seabed, and grow a new ocean from the seed of you."

I hated being called a _seed_. It made me feel pregnant without my consent._ _"And if I don't want to be an ocean?"

California stepped way too close and flexed his musclebound pecs. "Well, someone's got to do it."

It wasn't a question.

I have strong feelings about bodily autonomy. I turned tail and flat-out bolted for the bridge, leaping headstones and kicking up floral arrangements with California hot on my heels. The rolling hills of Athens fought me every step, and the Terrapin clanked against the jar full of Oconee, dragging me back. I'd reached the bridge over the Oconee River when that asshole caught up enough to shove me hard. I whomped onto my face, bit my cheek, tasted dirt and asphalt and blood. Woozily I glanced across the bridge. Washington and Oregon flanked the pillars, blocking my only escape.

"Quit that," said California. "You're only hurting yourself."

"Touch me again, and you'll have to answer to the University," I warned. "I'm a student." The University's old protective magic repelled meddling outsiders the same way Downtown had pushed back Oregon's tree invasion. Half the monuments on North Campus were actual people who'd crossed the University, even that plant cell sculpture behind Denmark Hall.

_"Are_ you a student? Are you really?"

I wondered what he meant by that. He loomed over me, taller than before, and I remembered he was really millions of souls taller, stronger, and angrier than me. He was going to bag me up and take me West to grow his ocean, and nothing I did could stop him.

"I hope the earthquake really does knock you into the ocean," I said.

"That would require an ocean first."

I shut my eyes. Down below, I heard the rushing of water.

It was getting louder.

The Oconee was flooding.

It happened so fast none of us had time to react, just California shouting _Whoa!_ and then the water cresting over us, the weight of it snapping through the rusty 100-year struts, and I was going to die by bridge to skull if I didn't drown first, if I didn't get kidnapped first, if I didn't die of grief first, and then everything was the arms of the Oconee, cradling me through the flood.

----

I floated sputtering to shore downriver not long after, my sopping wet backpack miraculously intact. I knew the Oconee Greenway forwards and back. Not far from Steeplechase Apartments, not at all. I took off at a woozy wet jog, squishing through mud and leaf mulch through the muscadine-laced thickets to reach Steeplechase before the Hypotheticals could regroup. I didn't know where to turn. What did California mean, asking if I was still a student?

I didn't understand until I got home and found the huge cardboard tube on my doorstep. They'd curled the diplomas into one endless thick scroll. I unspooled them across my apartment, all forty of them, from Accounting to Women's Studies. I could step from golden seal to seal without touching carpet all the way to Imani's salt-corpse. That was it, then. I'd graduated forty times over. The University wouldn't protect me from the Hypotheticals.

"What the heck am I going to do now?" I asked Imani's salt. I wasn't no hex-maker, no big powerful University. I was just regular old Quietly.

I hated Imani just a little right then, hated her because I'd gone along with her scheme to be forever students and never graduate, because she'd picked a fight with the West Coast and got me sucked into it, and now I had a whole can of coffee and it would probably go stale before I finished it because I had nobody to help me drink it, and because I was about to get dragged off for torture by Hypothetical States who had never tasted a muscadine.

As the sun sank lower, I could see them out the window lurking in the Steeple's shadow, short Oregon leading the line and California bringing up the rear, stomping on the skittering waterbugs come up from the Oconee for supper. My sore legs couldn't outrun them anymore. I trembled all over. Tonight I would dance myself to death while R.E.M. shook the walls of my apartment. By morning, I would be nothing but another heap of brine. The landlord would have to seal off our unit altogether, like that stairway at the University haunted by suicide ghosts.

I slumped among my useless diplomas and Imani's blank watercolors. The Hypotheticals murmured together outside, tinking and scratching as they fiddled with the lock. I cried into my sleeve. If I could take it all back, if I could do it over, I'd learn the bass guitar. I'd volunteer on charity night at the drag queen bar. I'd work at a coffee shop and learn the art of turning foam into ephemeral leaves on a sophomore's latte. If there were more time, I could put all my new degrees to work. If there were only more time, I could swim the Atlantic and learn to love it too.

I polished my glasses on my tear-soaked sleeve, which only smudged them worse. But when I put them back on, everything changed.

You know when you paint with lemon juice, then run the paper over a candle flame and messages appear? Like that, but more psychedelic. Through the brine-smudged lenses, Imani's watercolors exploded in detail. Full seascapes, just like she'd told me: thundering waves that rocked and sloshed against the borders and dribbled onto the carpet. And above them, hanging in the painted air, Imani's final message to me.

_Dear Quietly,_ it began at the clothesline over the kitchenette table, _I did an awful thing, but I'm about do something worse,_ and here the paintings zigzagged across the living room, _It's a sin to drink an ocean, you know. Bad enough they'll damn me to the Under-Ath for it. But I don't see no other way out,_ I followed the watercolors into the hallway that connected our bedrooms: _Don't go mourning for me, you hear? It's not a death. It only looks like one._ The watercolor-string ran around the walls of her bedroom in spiraling circles. _Tell the Hypotheticals I'll return the Pacific, but it could take a while. Truth is, I don't know how. I might need to cut a deal with an evil thing. But if there's a way, it's in the Under-Ath._ And right above the brine pile, this emphatic message: _DON'T FOLLOW ME._

Through my tear-streaked glasses, the pile of salt transformed into a spinning, watery vortex.

_Quietly, listen: Athens is a gyre too._

Out in the living room, the front door cracked and broke. I tore down Imani's last watercolor, because fuck that, right? Imani didn't know everything. She didn't understand her own curse, and she didn't know nothing about the Hypotheticals, or how to fight them. When you get down to it, who really can go it alone and come out in one piece? She would never find her way home from the Under-Ath, not without help, because that's the way of the world, it's the way of all love and friendship and damn amazing roommates.

I hitched my backpack tight around my shoulders and held the can of coffee beans in my hand. I jumped feet-first into the vortex and let the Under-Ath take me.

----

**Part 3: Atlantic**

You know that junk drawer in your kitchen, the one packed with bread bag ties and rubber bands and the wine cork too pretty to toss? That's the Under-Ath. It's where you'll find the rest of the church that once connected to the R.E.M. Steeple, the double-barreled Civil War cannon they never fired because they couldn't control the chained-together cannonballs, and every cigarette butt chucked out the window on Lexington Road.

It's mainly litter in the Under-Ath. Infinite ash fluttered down like snow from a dim gray sky without any sun or stars. Knee-deep litter blanketed the trees and buildings like gentle kudzu heaps. The Great Athens Garbage Patch.

I sunk waist-deep into the litter and struck out westerly toward what I hoped was Broad Street, along a huge gulch cut down the road like a giant dragged to her death. If Imani had left any trail, I couldn't make heads or tails of it. Pull tabs and bottle caps crunched under my heels, and a plastic fork worried a hole in my jeans. I kicked gritty cigarette ash from between my toes where my Crocs let it in.

It was hard going. All that plastic tugging at your legs, faceplanting you into stale fries and used condoms. Good thing I'd spent the summer stomping around the Okefenokee Swamp. The technique was similar: lift your feet high and tromp down firmly, and try to ignore anything wiggling down below.

After a couple hours, my calves burned something awful. I'd stopped to work a plastic six-pack ring out of my hair when some unseen critter snaked figure eights around my ankles. Its bristly warmth tickled my toes through my Crocs. I stomp-stomped to scare it off, but then all the litter around me roiled and boiled and humped and lumped, and with a surge and roar, the monster burst to the surface.

I'd never seen a critter so ugly. It had a head like an overgrown snapping turtle and a mane of gray moss, a long body, stump-fingered flippers, and a triple row of very big, flat molars. I froze petrified, which probably saved my fingers. It chomped the plastic rings clean out of my hands and dove back below the litter's surface. The other humps and lumps and roils and boils erupted into more sinuous creatures, scaly and furred, beaked and snouted, all of them snapping and fighting for choice trashy bits.

"Hey howdy!" Far ahead on the litter-river, some folks waved at me from a raft. I waved both arms back, sucking in my belly where critters brushed against me. The raft sped right on up, coasting smoothly over crumpled wrappers and diet sodas like they was nothing but placid water. They'd jiggered it together from a pallet of flattened cardboard roped with daisy-chained twistie ties. A man worked the rudder in the back, and up front a woman turned this huge crank attached to some braided plastic ropes trailing down into the litter-river. Ahead of their raft, the trash humped and boiled even more violently.

"Keep her harness tight, Opal! She's hungry today," shouted the man working the rudder.

The woman made some adjustments to the cranks, and suddenly the monster towing the raft broke the surface. It dipped in and out of view, long and spidery in a way that reminded me of millipedes. It bayed like a lonesome hound and dove sharply down, erupting again with cans clenched in its jaws. The navigator yelled _haw_ and the handler threw an easy lasso over the beast's front limbs, forcing its head back to a net trailing behind.

The whole raft skidded up beside me.

"Need a hand, friend?" the monster-wrangler called. "Ain't safe to cool your toes in the Oconee River, not when the Has-Beens are feeding." She pronounced _Oconee_ funny so it came out like _Oak-a-nee_.

"Thanks. I'd sure appreciate the lift." I grabbed her extended hand and scrabbled up onto the cardboard. It was nice to feel wind on my legs after so long in the sweltering garbage. But I didn't know how I'd ever get my pants clean of all the grease stains.

I couldn't tell much about my rescuers on account of the handkerchiefs they'd bound around their noses to keep out the garbage-smell, but their coveralls had the faded, patchy look of thrift store finds. There wasn't much space for sitting on the raft, not with all the collection bags: one for beer cans, one for bedsheets, one for batteries, and a whole zipper-bag full of spent bullets. You just had to sit on the junk itself.

I hunkered down on a bundle of styrofoam takeout trays with my backpack between my feet and watched them work. They called themselves Dill the navigator, and Opal the Has-Been wrangler, and they were working hard bringing in their haul.

"You headed to see Stephens at the New Foundry?" asked Dill.

"I don't know. Haven't heard of it," I answered honestly. "Depends if my roommate's there. You seen her? She's got the Pacific Ocean with her and lots of brine in her hair."

Opal turned the cranks and the lasso unfurled. The Has-Been crooned and dived down into the rubble again. "Might've seen an ocean passing through recently. Didn't stay long, though."

It weirded me out to hear anyone talk about Imani that way. Who knew what drinking down the ocean did to her if people saw her like that? "You mind pointing me in the right direction?"

"You don't look like you're from around here," said Opal. She twirled the ropes, concentrating hard on the river. Dill tossed a glance at her and snatched from the Oconee a large cardstock square attached to a wooden dowel.

"I'm from the Over-Ath," I explained. "Gonna collect someone. Then I'll be on my way."

Dill barked out a joyless laugh, and Opal whipped her head around. He dropped the cardstock sign lickety-split. An understanding flitted between them too fast for me to catch. I didn't like that much, not in this place. It set my stomach roiling.

"Go home, Dorothy," said Opal. "Your technicolor heart's a-bleeding. The Under-Ath don't want nothing from you but your wasted talent."

"Name's Quietly. I don't got much talent to begin with. If the Under-Ath wants it, I'll gladly trade to bring Imani home. I'm good at collecting syllabi."

"Everyone collects something in the Under-Ath," said Opal. "That's the problem, ain't it? Somebody's gotta do without."

"Amen to that," said Dill.

Opal flung out the ropes again. Dill flattened the handpainted cardstock sign. It said, _You Can't Arrest An Idea_. He lifted up his handkerchief and took a chomp out of the corner with glittering sharp teeth that gleamed as he turned. There was something wrong with his neck. It extended too long and wobbled like it had a few extra vertebrae.

The dowel crunched between his molars.

Opal spun around. _Pissed._ "The hell you doing, Dill?"

Dill's neck stabilized before my eyes, settled down to its proper proportions, and his teeth looked normal and blunt. He let the handkerchief drop back into place. "Just grabbing a bite. Missed breakfast."

"Really? I'd call it theft of company property."

"It was just floating there, Opal. He'll never notice."

"He'll know, Dill."

"Not if nobody don't tell him, he won't," Dill hissed.

"He'll _know_."

_"Then don't say nothing."_

Opal dry-spat at him. "Won't need to."

I threaded both arms through my backpack frontways so the Oconee River's jar pressed against my belly. Behind me, Dill's chewing continued. "Where are y'all headed, anyway?"

"Just finishing up our shift, then back to the Foundry for our lunch break," said Dill. "You're welcome to come with. If you're looking for work, you can talk to Stephens."

"Who's Stephens?" I asked.

"The one man in the Under-Ath that pays in whatever currency you need," said Opal. "He's the reason any of us are still here." She tugged back sharply on the harnessed Has-Been. "Word of advice: mind your manners around him. He don't truck with rudeness or bad breeding." Another dagger-look at Dill. "And don't steal his product."

"I didn't!" said Dill.

"Tell _him_ that."

I supposed it wouldn't do no harm to speak with him. I had no other leads. The raft drifted along, collecting more cans from the water. This time, I saw just how hard the Has-Been struggled to keep the smashed beer can in its teeth, writhing against the restraints. The plastic braided rope had rubbed its fur away in patches, leaving bruise-stained skin scaled in red scabs.

----

I'd worked up quite an appetite by the time we got to the Foundry on account of having forgotten to pack anything edible for my adventure. We docked the raft on a parking lot clear of litter beside a thousand other cardboard rafts.

Something about it made me sick down to the pit of my stomach: endless thirsty asphalt fingers stretching toward the Oconee Grayway, the floodlights sapping all the color from your face and arms like an inverse sun. The building squatted between the shell-shocked ghosts of failed coffee shops. Into that building all the foragers streamed, carrying their finds in shrink-wrapped bundles high on their backs like rice-paper sushi rolls. Like sandwiches at a picnic. Like leftover chocolate cake, because damn I was getting hungry and even garbage looked good if I turned my head sideways and squinted a little.

"Y'all said something about a lunch break?" I asked Dill and Opal. We stowed all the cans into shrink-wrap cocoons on the dock while their poor harnessed Has-Been whimpered and whined and nosed the empty raft.

"After you talk with Stephens. We don't just hand out company lunch to anybody who asks," said Opal.

Together we turtled across asphalt that was somehow summer-hot even beneath that slate-gray sky. There was an old Foundry in the Over-Ath, an ancient factory-turned-restaurant, but nothing like this place. This Foundry demanded all your attention. It practically had its own gravity.

My stomach whined and needled at my gut. Opal looped behind the building to the employee entrance. "Remember: mind your manners. Stephens ain't a man to cross, not in the Under-Ath." She pointed me toward the Manager's Office.

Stephens was so small and skinny you could probably butter biscuits with him if you were short a knife. His suit swallowed him up to the neck, stopped by a slantwise bowtie just below his upturned white collar. He kept twitching and shuddering all over like his skin itched him, and when he moved, his joints squealed like a rusty icebox door. Damp tea bags hung dripping on a tiny clothesline behind his chair. He sipped iced tea from an empty tennis ball tube and read from an newspaper so old that Nixon headlined it.

I sucked on my dry teeth. That tea was the first liquid of any kind I'd seen in the Under-Ath. He glanced over cracked spectacles and a smile poured across his lips like warm honey. Almost pleasant, except that smile squeaked so loud I clenched my teeth.

I thought of Imani all brine-covered and alone, self-banished to the Under-Ath with no hope of redemption or return. I licked my cracked lips and extended a hand. "Sincere apologies for disturbing your meal," I said. "I've been told you're the man to see about an ocean."

His handshake clung wet and sticky like bubblegum on a hot sidewalk. I wiped my hands against my jeans. "Alexander H. Stephens, Foundry manager. And you are?"

"Quietly Jensen. I'm from the Over-Ath."

He waved me to an extra chair. I unslung my backpack. The Mason jar clinked against the Terrapin can. Stephens eyeballed my bag. "College student?"

"Recent grad," I corrected.

"Naturally. Looking for work? We're always hiring." He poured me some iced tea into a rusty green bean tin. It tasted thin and bitter and very salty and —_suddenly spinning and spinning and sixty-two languages, most of them extinct_. I let it trickle back into the tin unswallowed.

"Dunno," I said neutrally. "Mainly I'm looking for my roommate Imani. She passed this way recently, or so I'm told. She's in the habit of appearing as an ocean as of late."

He flashed a whole top row of ivory teeth probably made from elephants. "I recall the one. She's at the Georgia Theater. Working for me now. Perfectly fair and beneficial to all parties of course, but I'm afraid she's a private ocean now. Not open to the public."

"She'll see me. I'm her best friend." I said it with enough steel in my voice that Stephens set down his tea.

"Apologies. I haven't made myself clear." Big, creaky smile. "The Georgia Theater is private grounds. Off-limits." He took a long, slow sip of salty tea and rolled it around his mouth. "Unless..."

That asshole. I hated having to get along like this. Never could do passive-aggression, not like my mama could. "Unless what?"

"My employees have access, of course," he finished, predictably. A cricket skittered from his right nostril and back into the left one.

"I'm not really looking for work," I said. "With all due respect. I mean, I'm sure your establishment is as fine as they come. It's just not for me."

His lips screeched open again. Something buggy hopped out of his mouth, down the desk, and out the door. "Come with me, young lady. Let me show you a few somethings."

"You lost your cricket," I said.

----

For such a short man, Stephens stepped high and long, like his legs had an extra joint in them. I had to scramble to match his pace.

"Here at the Foundry, we harvest locally-sourced desires and store them up for those who need them." Stephens burst through double swinging doors into a warehouse with towering stacked shelves. "All those secret things you crave when nobody is watching." I jogged behind him down the aisle maze, knocking ash off my Crocs. "For example, take a look here. They say football's king in the South, but it's really Religion people crave. I've got rifles engraved with the Psalms and gasoline-soaked wooden crosses in size Medium, Large, or Extra Large." His joints screeched and whistled like a bad grocery cart as he pointed things out. "Down that way you'll find homebrew meth wrapped in cellophane, tied up in pretty pink bows. Bricks from the Morton Theater. Deeds written to the Creek and Cherokee. All the Civil War bayonets that never passed through Athens. I've got something for every appetite."

We reached an intersection. Dill was stacking cardstock signs on a pallet.

Stephens creaked to a stop. "Why you working, Dill? Isn't it lunchtime?"

"Just getting in a little overtime." Dill dropped cardstock on the floor. The one on top said, _Love Is Power_. "Trying to get ahead while it's quiet in here."

Stephens nabbed the castoff sign and rolled it into a pink tube. "Ain't you getting hungry, though?"

Dill waved him off. "Nah, I'm good." He tried to take the tube back, but Stephens held it to his lips. Little black crickets boiled over his teeth, down the tube, made short work of the cardstock, then skittered back into Stephens's mouth.

"Pack up, Dill," said Stephens. "You're out of work."

"But —"

_"Get out._ You want to forage? Go out there and keep yourself fed, if you think you can find enough out there without my help. _Get."_

Dill fled toward the exit, but not quick enough. Stephens unhinged his jaw and out poured the crickets. Hundreds, thousands, bajillions —a thick black tube of wings and legs and high-pitched whining funneling down the aisles, an insectile river. I turned tail and fled the way I'd come, but there was no escaping, not with all of Stephens's insides swarming about. I stumbled backwards on a heavy flat sack. It was Stephens's empty skin. It flopped and wiggled after me.

I twisted through the pallet maze in the warehouse. It was garbage top to bottom, stale beer and dishwater and fermented snotty tissues.

"Hey, what's the hurry?" shouted Opal. I skidded to a standstill. Opal leaned out a door, eating paint chips out of a pretzel bag.

"Dill," I gasped. "Crickets!"

She crunched up a whole handful of paint. It coated her gums with rainbow flecks. "It's what he gets, trying to steal from Stephens. Should've waited for lunch."

I didn't get it. At least with the Hypotheticals you knew why they were pissed. "Seems if a man wants to eat himself a protest sign now and then, it don't do any harm. Leastwise it shouldn't cost him his job."

"This isn't the Over-Ath," said Opal. "Nothing here is disposable."

"Except Dill, you mean."

Stephens's joints screeched and squeaked as he strolled up behind me. "Thanks for catching her, Opal. I'll take it from here." His baggy skin slapped along the concrete floor like overlarge trousers. A cricket conga line flowed up from the aisles into his ears, nostrils, eye sockets, and mouth, slowly reinflating him.

He steered me back toward his office with fingers boneless as raw hot dogs. "We all got to depend on each other here, Quincy. You try to break out of your place, and we all die. Do you understand?"

"It's Quietly," I muttered.

In his office, he plucked a damp teabag from the clothesline. "You must understand. I take breach of contract very seriously."

"Why would I ever work for you, then?" I asked honestly. "Sounds like a lousy deal."

"Because everyone's hungry for something. What're you craving, Quincy?"

The kettle whistled, and he set a cup of tea before me. I thought over that whole warehouse of recycled junk. The religion-laced sports didn't appeal, nor did the protest signs, paint chips, styrofoam, or endlessly resteeped tea bags. It was all garbage. I wanted tacos, or at least a beer. "I just want Imani. Please and thank you."

Stephens swished that salty tea around his mouth. His cheeks pinked and his creaking joints calmed. "She don't belong to you."

"She's a person. She don't belong to anyone but herself."

Stephens sucked on his teeth. His darting tongue was cricket-black. "Oceans aren't people, Quincy. They're places. First to find 'em gets to keep 'em." He licked brine from the teacup rim in this slow, sensual way that insulted sex and oceans and human tongues.

It made my blood boil clear out of my ears. I channelled my sainted grandmother and honey-coated my anger so it stung like bees. _"Excuse me_. I recall you now. Alexander Stephens. You used to be the Confederate Vice President." He wilted a snitch beneath the heat of my tone. "Nobody at the University even knows you're an alumnus anymore. They don't teach us that."

I braced for shouting, but instead there was just a slow and creaky frown as all those crickets rearranged his face from the inside. "Be that as it may," said Stephens, "you don't make the rules here, Quincy. Sign up or shut up. You don't get to see her otherwise."

Well, at this point I was fucking sick and tired of people trying to dictate my career path to me. Half demanding I sign away my soul to this man's mining operation, and whole 'nother peanut gallery telling me I had to become the fucking Pacific Ocean because _someone_ had to do the job, it didn't matter who. They only cared their vacancies got filled, like the sum of all human meaning amounted to finding the nearest pegless hole and pounding your own skull into it. I didn't want to be no dropout or rockstar or foreign ocean. But when given a limited set of terrible options, sometimes you had to settle for rejecting the worst instead of picking the best.

Alexander H. Stephens stuck out his wet bubblegum hand, and I noticed a tiny tattoo on his thumb, a dark whirlpool, a gyre in negative, a sucking wind that never let go of you. Evil wasn't the only thing people tried to bury. Sometimes they wanted to obliterate your goodness, too.

"Name's Quietly," I said, loudly. "I'll see you at the Georgia Theater."

"I'm very sorry to hear that," said Stephens, shaking his head. "Very sorry indeed."

My world exploded into crickets.

----

Stephens left me dangling above the river in a wire dog kennel swinging on a pole, counter-balanced at each corner with trash bags full of crushed cans. No lock or even a door, because below me the trash boiled with Has-Beens probably waiting to eat me. I was too damn hungry to hold the sentiment against them. I would've filled my knotted hungry stomach with anything, even kale or decaf Starbucks or black licorice.

Terrapin and Jittery Joe's knocked on my ribcage through the backpack. My stomach begged me to invite them in. Beer and coffee would make a terrible supper, but a hell of a lot better than nothing. I turned gently in my cage and the whole apparatus swayed dangerously, sending the Has-Beens into a snapping frenzy. Slowly I finagled my backpack to my frontside.

"You tattled on me," Dill snapped, startling the hell out of me. Turned out the cage next door wasn't so empty. "You cost me my job. Thanks a lot."

"I didn't say nothing to Stephens." I death-gripped the backpack to my chest. Precious cargo. "Can't see how it's any worse out here, though. They don't even have real food, you know."

Dill tossed an empty Diet Cherry Coke can at a Has-Been tugging a half-sunk raft several yards behind it. The harness had slipped partway off and rubbed chunks of pelt from the beast's flank. "Just look at that critter." It wiggled like a puppy, licking the can round and round in trash-circles.

I didn't mind the Has-Beens after that first shock. They sported too many teeth, maws big enough to grind me up and leave nothing but a Quietly stain on the pavement. But they didn't seem malicious. I didn't hold their hunger against them no more than I'd blame a grizzly. Worlds better than Stephens or the Hypotheticals.

"They're not so bad," I told Dill. "Kinda cute, like this armadillo that built a nest in my recycling bin once."

The Has-Been grunted and spat out the can uneaten. Dill huffed and shifted in his cage, rummaging deeper into the bag he'd pulled open. "Opal and I can't figure out what she's really after. She rarely eats the cans she finds. Ain't _you_ hungry yet?" I noticed his neck had regrown those extra vertebrae since I last saw him. In the swaying kennel, his head bobbled extra, all cartoony.

"Absolutely starving," I said, unzipping the backpack carefully. The whole cage swayed and bobbed, dipping closer to the snapping Has-Beens.

"That's how they get you, you know," Dill continued. "You think you're full of hunger, but that's not really it."

"Then what is it, Dill?" I snapped. I'd gone hangry and just about run out of patience.

"It's _yearning._ For something else. Something you left in the Over-Ath."

That gave me the all-over chills. Brought up bad memories of Imani's last days, smitten to death with a stolen ocean while those Hypotheticals gloated nearby. It seemed like everyone alive bore a yearning that didn't do you no good. I longed for nothing short of Imani herself, but I couldn't compete with an ocean for her affections. Even if I found her, I'd be no closer to what I wanted.

The truth about those forty college degrees? I'd never wanted to stay in school forever. I just didn't want to graduate from Imani.

"It's going to happen to you too, you know," said Dill. "You'll become just like me. Like _them._" He nodded down to the monsters in the river, that long bobbling head reaching past the bars now.

My eyes narrowed at him. "Wait a minute. What are you saying?"

"If you don't get fed." His voice had a hollow, stretched-out quality, slow and slurred like a bee-stung tongue. "If you don't eat down your desires. Why we all work for Stephens. Otherwise, the Has-Beens. Everyone else."

I gawped down at the swirling monsters, those warm eyes swallowed up by too much fur and scales. All my Imani-angst washed away in perfect technicolor rage. "Those are human beings you're lashing to your rafts? Those are _people?_ _Well, bless your heart_."

"Used to go. To protests," Dill said, his whole face bulging and monstrous. "In the Over-Ath. Don't remember. What about. No more. Starving when. I got here. Ate garbage. Anything. Stephens saved me. The signs. I need the signs. Stephens hoards 'em."

"Everyone's hungry for something," I ventured. The Has-Beens. Desperate foragers, diving for anything that settled, yearning for the smallest taste of their desires. "If you don't eat, you turn into one of _them?_"

Dill's kennel pressed latticework wire into his spiraling, monstrous bulk. Fur sprouted all over him just as quick as the wire could scrape it off. I winced and felt my neck, counted vertebrae against the growling of my own stomach.

"What about Stephens?" I asked desperately. "What is he hungry for? What keeps him human?"

He mushed and champed his lips together. His whole mouth had melted like a mudslide into swollen gums studded with sharp teeth. "Waaaaaa," he moaned. Not the least bit human anymore. The kennel burst from his bulk, and the creature that had been Dill fell into the litter-river and I lost him among the others.

I didn't have time to look, because Dill's fall had upset the balance of my own cage, which bucked and bobbed dangerously. I grabbed the cage's sides, but I hadn't had the chance to re-zip the backpack. To my horror, my one and only can of Terrapin beer popped from the open pocket and rolled out the cage door.

"Shit," I said to nobody in particular. So much for maintaining my current number of vertebrae. That left becoming one of Stephen's sharp-nosed litter hounds, or jumping down and letting the Has-Beens chaw on me directly. Both options distinctly lacked in Benefiting Quietly.

One of the Has-Beens bellowed and flung litter in the air with its tail.

"Pipe down," I shouted back. "You'll get your taste soon enough."

It bellowed again. The Has-Been lashed to the raft —the one Dill and Opal used —had gone positively bonkers, bucking and flailing and twisting against its harness. The braided plastic ropes dug out gouges in its flesh inches deep. White bone showed through the bloody mess.

"Hey, cool it. You're hurting yourself," I said.

It bellowed louder, twisted and bucked again. The raft rocked. It was caught on something under the litter.

I rubbed my head and wondered how I would tell this story to Imani if we ever saw each other again. She'd call me a liar, probably. For someone with glacier blood, she sure could be skeptical. "Promise you won't eat me?" It moaned and bellowed, but piped down. I supposed it would have to do. "I'm coming down."

I slung the backpack on my shoulders. I threw my weight against the kennel, first one way, then the other, so it pendulumed back and forth, back and forth, closer to the harnessed Has-Been and away from the swarm beneath. I aimed for a filthy twin mattress half-bobbing among some sacks of old molding books. Then I leapt out flying-squirrel-like and landed hard against the corner. It smarted, but I floundered over to the Has-Been and worked at the twisted plastic.

"We've got a deal, right?" Has-Been blood greased my fingers where I dug the bonds out from its chafed flesh. "When you're free, take me with you."

I tore away the knotted plastic ropes. The monster dove down sharp into the litter. I clung to its back with the remaining tangles. Down, down, down. Litter brushed and banged me, tore at my hair and skin, smeared me with stink, and then the surface again. The Has-Been skidded along the trash, carrying me away from the Foundry, away from Stephens, away from Imani, into unknown parts of the Under-Ath.

----

She brought me to her nest on the shores of the Oak-a-nee in the shadow of a decayed brick factory. It had a hipster-industrial look to it that reminded me of Normaltown.

The Has-Been had built a nest of aluminum and glass: Coke and juice bottles, lemonade and beer and energy drinks. The Has-Been nestled into the clattering mess, swirling around and around so the empties rang like wind chimes and threw rainbows on the asphalt. She spat my Terrapin can at my feet, whole and undamaged.

I rolled it between my hands. It was warm and a bit sticky from her spit. "Thanks."

 Cans clattered around her swirling tail. The monster nosed through her collection until she'd inched one from the heap. Some Three-Buck Chuck from Trader Joe's. She licked at the sticky residue around its rim. Deep in her throat, she crooned with the same heat that had driven her to gouge ropes into her own flesh.

"You don't want the can at all," I realized. "You want the beer."

Those huge brown eyes, those sad human eyes.

I popped open the Terrapin. It fizzed out all the shaken-up pressure. Automatically I sipped the foaming head. It tasted like flowers in faraway Athens, like hot summers tailgating with Imani and our friends, and while I still wanted a meal, it took the edge off my desire.

The Has-Been whimpered. What did it feel like to be so close to everything you needed, if only a stranger would offer you a taste?

I set the can on the dirt between us. "Cheers."

The Has-Been curled her tongue around the can and rolled the whole thing into her maw. As it went down, she sighed. She shivered all along her length, those vertebrae aching to disappear into shinbones and all that fur wanting to grow backward.

She packed her body up into a human-sized bag, neat as can be. She became a woman tough as bone, with skin so dry and rice paper-thin I thought her skeleton might walk right through it. She was six feet tall and still licking the sticky rim of the Terrapin beer can. A single drop of beer hit her tongue. I wondered how many empty cans you had to lick to build up any kind of buzz.

"Ahhh." The woman leaned toward me like it was the first day of Spring and I was the long-lost sun. "I've been waiting a long time for a beer." She extended her hand. "Thanks, friend. Name's Briar."

"I'm Quietly," I said. "Is the change going to last long?"

Briar slouched against the factory steps and wrapped her arms around her bell bottoms. "Probably not. Gotta eat every day, same as everyone else. Shame you can't get much of anything without Stephens's stash nowadays."

"It wasn't always like this?"

"Nah. Used to be there was enough to go around. Used to be most of us weren't monsters, just hungry all the time. Until Stephens showed up and 'organized' it all." Briar tossed the can away hard so it avalanched down the bank.

"Why don't y'all just go back to the Over-Ath?" I asked. "Plenty of beer there."

"Sometimes we try," she said. "But we wind up lonesome and lost in the waterways, no closer to our desire than before. The Oconee eventually washes us down to the sea, and that's oblivion for a Has-Been. Piece of advice: don't ever immerse yourself in the Atlantic, not unless you're sure of yourself."

"What's so bad about the Atlantic?" It struck me as a cuddly barrel of kittens after what the Pacific had put me through.

"The Atlantic's made of love and parting. Quaker brides and rough explorer men, and all those people ripped from their homes in Africa. They tossed their tears like bottles upon the waters and prayed them across the waves until they lapped at Florida and Haiti, where they saw such sorrows they returned again even more tearful. Imagine trying to find your own desire in all that. You'll lose yourself if you try."

It seemed like a sad existence, pushed forever away from Athens, away from your heart. "Tell me about the ocean that passed through recently."

"I haven't seen that much water in the Under-Ath in all my time," Briar said. "It took the form of a woman and smelled of anger and ozone. Made a righteous wreck of the Oak-a-nee Grayway, carried off half the trash before rushing toward Downtown. You can see Lexington Road again. Shouldn't be hard to track her down if you follow it."

Briar pointed out the gorge that ran along the river's far side. A glacier's angry path all the way to the Foundry —and beyond. "I tried down that way already. Stephens wouldn't let me near her. Said she works for him now."

"Of course he would. Stephens desires what he can't have. Anything new's bound to catch his interest," said Briar. "That's why he hates the Has-Beens so much. He can't stand that some of us would say no to him. So he enslaves us once we turn monster. You'd better not leave your ocean with him too long. He'll find a way to subdue her."

I tried to count up the days since finding salt in Imani's bed, but recent grief made the dates run together. "She's already been here a while. Days. Weeks."

Briar wrapped her hand around my wrist so tight it made my nerves blood-drunk. "Don't you wait. You get to her _now_, before he makes her forget there ever was blue skies and muscadines beside a lazy brown river."

I remembered crickets so thick it blocked out sight and sound, and still I hesitated. "He called her a private ocean. Said I had to sign a contract to see her."

"People under his employ can always leave," said Briar. "That's always been the rule. Most of them don't, but they can."

"He said he owns her."

"Well, that's something new," Briar admitted. "Trying to bend the rules in his favor. Well, convince her to leave. He can't hold her if she says no."

That was that, then. Imani needed me. I had a clear path and only Stephens to stop me. "I'd better get going."

Briar tossed me a smile worn soft around the edges from use. "Good luck. And thanks for the beer."

I shook ash from my Crocs and cinched up the backpack, now a little lighter without the Terrapin. My stomach hurt awful, and my head spun a little on account of the alcohol on an empty stomach. I didn't know how to stop him anymore than I knew how to put back an ocean, anymore than I knew how to rein in Imani's wild, wonderful, destructive moods. But far away in space and time, a woman and a glacier had sailed around the world after a star, and at last found each other. I could hope for that.

I struck off toward the gorge gashed through the litter, the mark left by Imani's passage. I got about five steps away before I tripped straight into California's fist.

----

The suckerpunch stunned me so bad I tumbled dazed and winded into the ankle-deep litter. A Birkenstock and a Big Foot sock landed at the edge of my peripheral vision, wafting in the odor of stale weed and stale cyclist.

"Grab her legs," said Washington, "and get her backpack."

"Watch out. There's another one," said Oregon. I heard Briar cry out, then another solid _thwack_ from California's mean left hook, and a _thunk_ as she tasted dirt. That bastard had gotten her too.

They pinned me spread-eagle to the litter. I struggled hard, but they had six hands and I only had the two. We must've made a funny litter-angel in the trash. I didn't stand a chance, winded from that suckerpunch. I got this odd sense of calm, like when you know the car is going to hit you and all you can do is accept it. I found myself giggling uncontrollably.

"Where's Hawaii, anyway?" I asked.

They flushed a little and craned their necks upward. California glowed orange against the ever-gray sky. "We don't need to talk about Hawaii," he said.

"The heck?" I giggled even harder. "If y'all are so mad, shouldn't Hawaii be out for my blood and muscle and my great-grand's bones?"

Oregon worried her lip between her teeth. "We don't always agree about changes. Hawaii doesn't want the ocean back. They like all the extra space."

"That's messed up," I said.

"Seriously," California agreed.

It was strangely companionable for an instant, except for the part where they had me pinned on my back. "Hey, let me up? I bet we can get this sorted if we just talk it over."

"I don't trust her," said Washington. "She'll run from us again."

"Let's just transform her now and be done with," said California. "Home by tomorrow morning. Sooner, if the wind blows in our favor."

"Go right ahead and make me your ocean if you'd like. I don't care," I said. "I'll probably turn into a monster anyway. Thing is, this has gotten a lot bigger than your quarrel with Imani. Wouldn't you rather have the real Pacific back instead of an East Coast knockoff?"

Oregon closed her eyes and inhaled deep. "She's right. The Pacific is here somewhere. I can smell it and feel it surging in my bones. God, but it aches."

California let go of my arms. I sat up, elbowing him in the face totally accidentally without even a hint of grudge or malice.

"Okay. We'll hear you out, but make it quick," said Washington. "Where are you keeping the Pacific?"

"Briar?" I called out. "Briar, you okay, friend?"

Briar stirred in the litter nearby and moaned. She was outgunned in her elderly human form. "I'm alright," Briar said. "Got me twisted up in the six-pack rings again." I helped her untangle and stand up. Briar stretched her long arms up toward the ash-gray sky and rubbed her bruises.

"Now. About the Pacific," I said. I explained all about my adventures at the Foundry, and about Imani's captivity. "The problem is that cricket-swarm in a suit. He seems to lay down the law around here. He claims Imani's private property now, but Briar says it's against the rules of this place." My skin crawled all over like dirty little cricket-legs marching up and down inside my skin. "He don't seem human to me."

"He's definitely not human," said Washington.

"He's a Hypothetical," said Oregon. "Same as us. He exists to meet some purpose, and he's not going anywhere until he fulfills it."

"And what's that?" I asked.

California placed a hand on my shoulder where a bruise had formed there from one of my tumbles into the litter. I flinched, and he snatched his hand back. Maybe he finally made the connection between human bodies and frailty. I sure hoped so. "Everyone in this place is hungry for something," said California. "Stephens exists to satisfy the people here."

"There is no river in the Under-Ath," said Briar. There was weight to her voice, heavy stones sunk down deep. "People here are endlessly thirsty. It can't be done."

"A Hypothetical gone mad," Washington whispered. "Unable to finish his mission, unable to quit."

"Or unwilling to," I said. "What happens when y'all finish your missions?"

"We return to whoever created us," said Oregon. "Like meltwater to the lakes and rivers in Spring."

"So you cease to exist," I said.

"In a manner of speaking," Oregon said slowly, haltingly, like she had never seen it that way before. "I suppose it's no different than you humans. Where are you before you begin, and what happens when you end?"

"Even still," I told her. "Even still." My throat got all lumpy, thinking on the implications. I even managed some pity for California. If he ever brought his ocean home, he'd dissolve into it forever for his troubles.

We all got real quiet, measuring the weight of it. I clutched my backpack close to my stomach. The Oconee River swirl against my ribcage through its jar. My one true friend left in this place. I remembered Imani's thirst in her final days, all that brine in her hair, and how she made eyes at the Pacific like a lovelorn bride. A sick tickly feeling wormed through my stomach. Only days before, she'd made those eyes at me. The same night California called himself into existence to tear us apart.

Sometimes the only cure for one desire is finding a new one.

"Tell me one thing," I asked California. "Those curses —those _gifts_ —you wished on Imani. Yearning. Abandon. Peace. Can you give them to other people?"

"Of course," said California. "Anyone we choose. As infinitely as the Pacific."

"Then I know what we need to do," I said. "It's time to fix the Under-Ath."

----

I had Briar take us right to the thick of the Has-Beens, the deepest dark of the Oak-a-nee where the Grayway gaped open on what should've been the road to Atlanta.

Imagine if instead of Highway 316 rolling through the countryside west of Athens, an ocean of garbage spilled into a huge pit. Litter roared down from the city forever, taking the last of its sins to a final grave.

I'd found the gyre at the heart of the Under-Ath.

"It's swarming with desire down there," Briar said. "All the oldest Has-Beens make their way here eventually. They can't swim up the litterfall once they slip over the edge."

The Hypotheticals hovered just behind me on the shore, smelling of all those someplaces I'd never been. Meeting them had changed me. Forever after, Douglas fir would give me displaced nostalgia.

"Take a good look," I told the Hypotheticals, waving down to the gyre. "Those folks down there need you. They've been so obsessed with climbing out of their own failure that they've forgotten about the yearning that drives them. The harder you grasp it, the quicker it runs between your fingers. Let's give them something new to yearn for. California? Point their hearts toward the Pacific."

"All of them?" asked California.

"Yes, all of them. And you," I turned to Oregon, "Give them abandon. Help them release the past. If they could learn to let go, they could leave."

"And the gift of peace?" Washington asked.

I wasn't rightly sure you could ever get peace so easy outside of a graveyard. Lose desire and you'd just quit life. "No, not that one. Not here. Not yet."

Briar plucked an empty beer can from the river and considered the sticky rim. "Desire alone won't be enough to get 'em up the litterfall. It's too steep. They'll kill themselves trying once you point them toward the Georgia Theater."

My eyes prickled with unshed regrets. I'd bruised my heart on such a wall before. I clutched my backpack tight, the blood roaring in my ears. "I know. I know. But I think I know another way."

The truth was Imani couldn't possibly be Imani anymore. No more than the Pacific was just the Pacific. They'd swallowed each other up. She'd changed, transformed, outgrown even her own glacier-blood. No glacier ever touched two continents at the same time. What swirled deep in her waters now, I didn't know. It scared me wondering.

"We're ready when you are," said California.

I unzipped my backpack and set down the Jittery Joe's tin and the Oconee River jar side by side. "Y'all better find a raft. When this is all over, make for the Foundry and do what you can about Stephens."

That left the rest to me and the Oconee.

We had a good heart to heart, the river and me. I unscrewed the jar, and it flowed up to my lips and spoke in wet river-words that tasted like rocks and fish scales and more than a little mud.

_I'm dangerous to drink, Quietly,_ it whispered to me. _Different from the Big Waters. If you drink me down, you'll lose yourself in me, and ain't nothing going to bring you out again._

"Don't you think I know that by now," I told it. "Don't you think I know why Imani just don't bust out and wipe this whole damn town from its shadow existence." I was scared as shit we'd find her too late, that she'd become the Pacific as truly and permanently as she was part glacier on her mother's side.

But I knew one surefire way to transform water. I crushed a few coffee beans and threw them into the Oconee's jar, where they bobbed on the surface and tinged the water browner. It wasn't what I'd call a proper cup of joe, but at least it was a distinction. A demarcation between Oconee and Quietly.

The Oconee reached a wave up toward me, an unspoken invitation.

"You don't mind?" I asked the Oconee. It was a sin to drink oceans, so this had to be at least a personal failing.

_I love you,_ it said.

I held the jar up to my lips. It bubbled up like a flood and gave itself to me. I drank it down to the last drop, coffee beans and mud and water all.

What's it like to drink a whole river? About like drowning in one, I reckon. I thought I was losing all my oxygen as the water filled up my blood. It pumped into my heart. I fell smitten with river things: long-legged skating insects, little torpedo-headed otters, surly catfish crawling through sand and rounded stones. I lounged long in lazy summer sunshine. I dwindled to a trickle in the heat. I opened my mouth and sucked down the rain, swelled up, broke my boundaries, the bankline, the skin of the creature called Quietly.

It reached my brain, and I knew secret river-thoughts. A wily dinosaur crawled beneath the delta where the Oconee met the Altamaha River. I numbered drowned bears, and I named the bacteria. I reached further out, past the Altamaha, to a place where my waters turned to salt, a place that tasted of love and infinite sadness. I glutted myself on all the sorrows I found there, savoring their bouquets, getting drunk on them, until at last I drank the tears of a woman called Quietly.

_I was once a woman_, I thought to myself, and the thought tasted like coffee.

I opened my eyes.

As the Oconee, I'd washed away the litterfall entirely and rushed fast down the gouge Imani left toward the Foundry, taking all the Has-Beens with me. They took to the water like they were born to it, all their spidery long legs oaring toward their heart's desire, toward the Pacific.

Then I was Quietly —but also more-than-Quietly —standing on asphalt before the Foundry, my fists wet and dripping and my shoes full of pebbles. The Oconee swirled around and around inside me, holding to the bounds of my skin, restless, waiting, hungry.

I held the taste of coffee beans in my mouth and I let the river flood.

Water erupted from my shoes like a burst pipe. It wet the thirsty ash-choked asphalt. Plastic bottles floated around my ankles, rose to my knees, then my chest. The whole parking lot vanished beneath the spreading, roaring river. The water formed a wall, then a fist. I reached toward the Foundry and picked off its corners, rolling the cheap plaster between watery fingers. I grabbed the whole warehouse front and pulled it down.

The Has-Beens rode my flood into the warehouse and gobbled all that stockpiled desire. Centuries of Stephens's hoarding, consumed in moments. I reached under all the doors and tall shelves, groping for crickets in a man-suit, but I couldn't find him. Imani wasn't there.

I pushed the water forward, overwhelming the building and reaching the streets of Downtown beyond, driving the Has-Beens before me. They'd devoured the Foundry down to its screws, but still they stayed monsters because they chased another yearning. Broad Street to Jackson, Jackson to Clayton Street, and still the water rose.

My surface tickled and itched. A tiny fleet of amateur boats oared up from the Foundry, dipping my waters with oars made from vintage guitars. The old employees, freed of their contracts. They landed on the rooftops, grouped up, began to jam and improvise lyrics. It sounded a bit like R.E.M.

That's when I remembered Imani. _She used to be our roommate,_ I told the other voice. _Then she died and became the Pacific and forgot to be herself._

_We'll remind her,_ the other voice assured me.

Our waters rushed around and around the streets in ever-tightening circles —Lumpkin, Washington, Hull, Clayton —until the Georgia Theater sat dead center in the whirlpool.

She was on the roof, the highest point in all of Downtown, surrounded by a rave. A band jammed at her head, and dancers took turns chucking recycled glowsticks off the roof. They'd contained her infinite, pulsing shores in a cheap inflatable pool, the kind you stick in the backyard for your little cousins on the 4th of July. Two clubgoers paddled around her in their skivvies. Imani just tolerated it.

"God. What did he do to you?" I muttered, but I was the Oconee, and it turned into a roar threading all throughout the Under-Ath.

That's when I saw the crickets. Thousands and billions of the critters, skittering from gutters and dancing light across my waters and up, up, up the old brick buildings. Some of them ran, and others pelted down from the sky like screaming black raindrops.

The bugs spun together in a cricket-cyclone with Imani's pool at its center. Something thick and sludgy tickled my waters outside the Georgia Theater. Far below, the flattened, soaking skin of Stephens oozed its way from the flood onto the steps and climbed roofward. I pushed against the cyclone with all my waters, but the crickets shattered me into millions of droplets.

_This is my city,_ screamed the creaking swarm. _I make the rules._

"What's the point of you?" I asked him. "What state of need called you into existence? You've been trying for so long."

The crickets fiddled me an answer. _We are as old as the Under-Ath. We are the bones beneath the floorboards. This city consigned all their castoffs to this place and then had the gall to name itself for the Goddess of Wisdom. The hunger of the Under-Ath called us into existence._

There was so much of him. He went on forever, and still it rained more crickets. Those weren't really clouds blotting out the sun.

"You're only making it worse," I pointed out. "You've mined out the Under-Ath and put the goods under lock and key. Only your employees get fed. Everyone else starves."

_We desire their desire,_ hummed the crickets. _We don't want to die. We are not ready to die. We feed those who sign their contracts, and that is enough._

"That may very well be true. But you don't make that right by keeping Imani," I said. "She don't belong to you. She don't have anything to do with this mess."

_So much water,_ said Stephens. _Such abundance. Seaweed, fish, krill, whales, life and life and life. Hasn't been genuine water in the Under-Ath in a very long time. I'll drink her forever, sip by sip._

"So that's your angle, then? Salty tea for eons in your little office?"

_Trade yourself, then. Take her place. You are also full of good things. One is as good as the other. We could live on you for eons._

I shuddered a miles-long river-shiver. Those weak, oversteeped tea bags dipped into me, sweetened with a little aspartame so I'd slide quicker past Stephen's horrible little moustache into that oozing skin-sack.

But he'd already done just that to Imani.

_Take the deal. You have nothing to trade me but your whole._

Fuck that shit, right? I tossed along my watery length, hunting for the right raft. "Washington!" I called out in all my river-voices. "California! Oregon! Now, now! Do it now!"

Because he was wrong about one thing: trade isn't ever your only option. You can also give away. Capitalists always forget that.

What does it look like when you give the gift of peace to a malevolent whirlwind of insects and hatred? Like a storm dissolving after a rainy bleak night. Like when the sun rises and drives back the memory of thunder. As Stephens winked from existence, his desire snuffed, his purpose fulfilled, the crickets parted like a beaded curtain. I brushed them aside.

I reached out two hands and scooped Imani from her pool into my endless rivery arms, and here I lost myself again, because I was the Oconee, and in joining it I'd touched and tasted the faraway Atlantic. In my waters the Pacific and Atlantic met and mingled and became inseparable.

----

_Oh, there you are, Imani. I missed you._

_You shouldn't’ve come for me, Quietly._

_I reckon you're right, but I'm here now. I couldn't leave you trapped here forever._

_I'm not trapped. I exiled myself. Nobody here is strong enough to stop an ocean from going where it will. But I have to suffer for what I did._

_That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Let's go home._

_You can't rush redemption._

_Sure you can. Poof. There, I washed your guilt away with all the other garbage._

_It's still there, at the bottom of the sea._

_So? Some things we'll never be rid of, but that doesn't mean we can't move on. Oregon calls it "upcycling."_

_I did a bad thing, Quietly, and I can't take it back. I wanted to, but the yearning. I couldn't fight that yearning forever. I thought I was going to die from it. I had to drink it all down. But it wasn't mine. The Pacific didn't want to be drunk like that. I think it was afraid of me, afraid to become part of me this way._

_Not your fault. Not entirely. The Hypotheticals fucked you up. They've got to take their share of the blame._

_I don't know how to give it back. I don't know who I am anymore. I'm all dolphins and redwoods and muscadine wine, and I don't remember which of them belongs to me._

_You're a glacier. You're Imani. You're a vengeful environmentalist with too much magic and too much temper. And you're about to be a college dropout if you don't get back to school soon._

_I don't deserve to go home._

_It's not about deserving, Imani. It's about belonging. Now here, take this. I've brought you some coffee._

We woke up together on the Georgia Theater rooftop when the waters began receding. We kissed for a long time, waves lapping and retreating until they've covered the whole beach.

All around Downtown, the water had begun to settle in the huge gouges Imani had cut into the ground on her way into the Under-Ath. We were thoroughly soaked. The water had washed most of the salt from Imani's hair. I checked the Mason jar for the Oconee River, but it hadn't come back to me when we'd separated from it.

"You think they're still joined together?" Imani asked. "The Oconee and the Pacific, I mean. They didn't have any coffee beans to separate out again."

"I think the Oconee's gone now, at least the part I brought with me." I got all choked up because the Oconee had been my friend, and it struck me as an unfair cost to pay.

But Imani, wonderful wise Imani, held me against the hollow of her neck. "Rivers understand change, Quietly. You mix with an ocean like that and something new has to be born from it. That's not the Oconee River or the Pacific Ocean out there."

"Then what is it?"

Imani combed back my damp hair with long fingers. "We could call it the Oconee Ocean."

So much for the water beside the land beside the water. But the Georgia red clay hadn't completely gone from my blood, nor the brine in my saliva. For the rest of my life my kisses would taste of the surf. We had all traded parts of each other, me and Imani, the Oconee and Pacific. Nothing could fully sort that out again, not even great coffee.

The Hypotheticals rowed to our rooftop on a pontoon made from chapel doors floated over netted plastic bottles. I refilled my empty Mason jar with water from the new ocean, then filled up a second bottle and handed it to Oregon.

"There you go. One sample of your ocean, more or less. That should be enough to return it to full force. The rest belongs to the Under-Ath now." A fair repayment to Briar and the rest. All those Has-Beens, quenched for good. They would have no more need for Stephens.

"Looks good to me," said Oregon.

"Hold up," Imani said sharply. She snatched the water bottle back from Oregon. "Don't you think I've forgotten about the garbage patch. No one's going home until you've done something about it." She got right in their faces so they backed all the way up to the roof's edge.

California held up his hands. "Okay, chill out. Our people are already on it."

"All of them?" asked Imani.

"All of them," Washington affirmed. "They've been traversing the ocean floor for days now, cleaning up the mess and taking it back to shore. We won't return the water until they're done."

Imani sized them up like she was weighing their character on the scales. "Do you trust them, Quietly?"

It was a good question. When it came to their nature, we had no word to go by but the Hypotheticals themselves. "I trust them to be true to their mission," I said. "I don't rightly know if we could call them friends. But I think they mean well."

"Then come visit us sometime when you get the chance," Oregon said. "Our gifts are yours to keep, after all."

Imani got this look halfway between despair and acceptance. "I'm never going to stop longing for it, am I?"

"We never do," said Washington. "The Pacific is part of you now."

I thought I understood. Living will always mean hurting a little, and wishing for things absent from our arms —just like the Has-Beens knew. Even oceans couldn't be everywhere at once. They picked a bed to lie in, and sometimes settled too far off for your heart's comfort.

But sometimes your ocean stays.

----

We returned home to an apartment draped with the trappings of absence and old grief. A bed full of salt, diplomas carpeting the floor, and a door tilted shut on broken hinges.

I shooed out a stray cat parked on the couch and set the Mason jar of Oconee Ocean water —unhexed, of course —on the coffee table. Imani rolled up the diplomas and wedged the door shut with a Birkenstock too large to be one of ours. Together we gathered up Imani's sheet corners and shook the salt into the parking lot, enough to keep the sidewalks clear for a Southern winter.

"What now?" asked Imani.

I knew what she meant. You can't just come home from an adventure like that, tidy up, and call it done. I needed to get a job soon, and Imani still had to socially and legally resurrect herself. We'd melded with oceans, had our hearts broke, and lived to tell the tale, but it left a mark. Murky river-thoughts and heavy ocean-cares plucked and pulled at my attention. It felt like drowning in too many identities.

I looked out the living room window, down toward the thicket that marked the Oconee Greenway, and beyond that the sinking sun. Imani crept up behind me and slipped her fingers into mine, both of us lost in a westward pull we couldn't evict.

Maybe we'd follow the call. Maybe we'd leave Athens, buy a boat, circumnavigate South America, and make our way at last to the Pacific. Or maybe we'd just pick ourselves a new star and go after it as far as we could, until we sailed right into the tale of how an ocean, a river, and a little glacier entered my family tree.

But you have to hold some space for yourself. A place to stop being bodies of water, and just be bodies for a while. I marvelled at the miracle of Imani's hand in mine and wondered if I dared kiss her again. The Big Waters rolled ice-cold in my veins, but this time I held firm to the bounds of my skin. _Not here. Not now._ I shushed the oceans asleep, wrapped myself in brine-washed sheets, and let my glacier warm me.
