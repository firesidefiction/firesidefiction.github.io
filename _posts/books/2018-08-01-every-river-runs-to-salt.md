### Description

The Pacific Ocean is a big thing to steal, and Quietly's roommate Imani never does anything small. But then Imani goes and dies, and Quietly is left to travel to the Under-Ath (the underworld beneath Athens, Georgia), with angry gods at her heels, to clean up the mess Imani left behind and try to rescue her friend.

## Reviews
"Lyrical, raw, stubbornly poetic—Jones writes young love, cold water, and brutal magic. A painfully good read."

—Lilith Saintcrow

“Rachael Jones' novella is a striking journey into a new American myth. Jones has strapped afterburners onto her infamously lush prose, sending this story rocketing forward in a gorgeous whirlwind of unexpected tenderness.”

—Sarah Gailey
