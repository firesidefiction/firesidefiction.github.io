### Description

Turning someone you don't know into a vampire probably violates the Hippocratic oath. But Alex wasn't really thinking about that when he found a girl bleeding out in his shower.

Being turned into a vampire isn't as cool as it sounds. Especially when all Hannah wanted to be was dead. She thought she had finally escaped her brother. Until she woke up. Alive? Undead? Whatever. And now Hannah is stuck with the uncoolest vampire in existence.

As Alex and Hannah feel each other out — breaking some bones along the way — Alex’s oldest friend comes looking for help, and Hannah’s brother comes looking for her. What none of them see are the forces pushing them all on a collision course.
