### Description

Marshall Clayton Jensen's job is to fix things for the people too weird for the government to touch—witches, fairies, monsters. When Clay finds himself on the receiving end of a witch's curse following a breakup from the love of his life, a fairy named Cora, Clay enlists the help of his best friend Doc Irene and his ex-girlfriend's promiscuous sister Adelaide to search for a cure before time runs out.

## Reviews
