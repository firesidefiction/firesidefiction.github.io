### Description

Atlanta was supposed to be a new start. A place for Hannah to regroup and recover from her brother Zachariah’s betrayal. Alex would start his hematology fellowship and settle into his new role as Hannah's — guardian? friend? roommate? But trouble has followed them down to Georgia, and from “retired” spies to strong-willed grandmothers, it seems Hannah and Alex have a lot more shared history than either of them knew. And far to the north, Zachariah is trying to survive the rage of a vampire he can't kill and the affection of one who wants to be with him — forever.
