I'm pleased to announce that Fireside will be holding a submissions period from Monday, April 8 to Friday, April 12, 2019. This time around we're looking for stories, poetry, _and_ nonfiction pitches.

We're looking for fiction submissions of up to 1,500 words. We want stories of multiple lengths, but particularly stories under 750 words. We love short short stories, like Karl Dandenell's '[We Who Stay Behind](https://firesidefiction.com/we-who-stay-behind);' '[Junebug's Magical Magnificent Mercurial Barbershop](https://firesidefiction.com/junebugs-magical-magnificent-mercurial-barbershop)' by Malon Edwards, and of course, '[Parasitismo](https://firesidefiction.com/parasitismo),' by	Alberto Chimal (¡sí, aquí también se habla español!). See our [short fiction guidelines here](https://firesidefiction.com/submissions#short-stories).

We're also looking for [poetry submissions](https://firesidefiction.com/submissions#poetry). Poems can be up to 100 lines, of any genre, and of any form — free verse or formal verse are both fine! See our [poetry guidelines here](https://firesidefiction.com/submissions#poetry).

Finally, we're opening submissions for [nonfiction pitches](https://firesidefiction.com/submissions#non-fiction) for the first time. We're looking for short proposals for essays that take on real-world subjects like politics, social justice, futurism, and more, and treat them in a compassionate, thoughtful, and challenging way. Some recent essays we've published that you may want to take a look at are '[Impostor/Abuser: Power Dynamics in Publishing](https://firesidefiction.com/impostor-abuser-power-dynamics-in-publishing)' by Sarah Gailey; '[Reclaiming the Right to the Truth](https://firesidefiction.com/reclaiming-the-right-to-truth)' by Tariro Ndoro; and '[Imagining the Past: Speculative Fiction and the Recovering of Black History](https://firesidefiction.com/imagining-the-past-speculative-fiction-and-the-recovering-of-black-history),' by Phenderson Djèlí Clark.

Our submissions portal will open from the 8th to the 12th of April, and each type of submission will have its own separate form. Once the submissions period starts, we'll have links to each form, as well other pertinent information, on [our submissions guidelines page](https://firesidefiction.com/submissions).
