We’re thrilled to reveal to you all the cover for Hillary Monahan’s upcoming novel from Fireside Press: [_Gunsmoke & Glamour_](/book/gunsmoke-and-glamour), which goes on sale for pre-order  today on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Gunsmoke-Glamour-Hillary-Monahan/dp/0998778370/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1538049211&sr=8-1), [Apple Books](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/gunsmoke-glamour/id1437197835?mt=11), [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/gunsmoke-glamour-hillary-monahan/1129621661?ean=9780998778372), and [Kobo](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/gunsmoke-glamour). It will also be available in print and ebook on the Fireside Shop on November 20.

_Gunsmoke_ is a fun, raunchy ride through a weird west full of fairies and witches, spells and curses. It follows Marshall Cayton Jensen as he travels the Wild West in search of a cure for a deadly curse, accompanied by his best friend Doc Irene, and his girlfriend’s sister, Addy.

When it came time to find an artist to illustrate _Gunsmoke & Glamour_, we had a clear mandate--if you know Hillary, you know that she’s outspoken in her support for representation, and _Gunsmoke _ reflects Hillary’s idiosyncrasies: Doc Irene is a trans woman, and Adelaide is a fat, sexy lady. The cover had to represent these characters well, and celebrate them rather than try to hand-wave then away.

Enter [Eli Hoyt](http://eli-hoyt.squarespace.com). Eli’s work is heavily inspired by anime and manga, and his combination of cartoony style and romantic subject matter works well to reflect _Gunsmoke_’s slightly madcap tone, as well as its ‘foolish love’ plot. Once we got talking about the characters and themes in the novel, he got it immediately--we needed a slightly put-upon, low-key ridiculed male lead, since Hillary works hard in the novel to subtly subvert toxic masculinity through our protagonist; we needed a strong and confident Doc; and an unabashedly fat and sexy Adelaide to bring the cover home. Oh, and a tiger. Because, well, because ZOMFG BIG KITTEH.
