It's awards season. And that means that it's time for us to bug you, dear readers, bout nominating and voting for some of our fantastic short fiction. We've been pretty low-key about this stuff for the last five years, but as much as we always say we don't care about awards, that fact is that they do matter, if only in terms of visibility (I won't lie-it's nice to know that people dig our work, too). We win awards, more people know about us, more people give us money, we get to pay for more kickass writing and artwork. Rinse, repeat—it's the circle of life. 

So with that in mind, here's a few things to keep in mind as you fire up your internets to vote and nominate:

If you're a member of SFWA, please vote for A. Merc Rustad's story [_This is Not a Wardrobe Door_](http://firesidefiction.com/issue29/chapter/this-is-not-a-wardrobe-door/) for the Nebula Award. The last day to vote is March 30th.

If you're nominating for the Hugos, there are a ton of great resources out there that can help you get a good sense of everything that's eligible for an award this year. Check out [this spreadsheet](http://bit.ly/hugoaward2017), [this wiki](http://hugonoms2017.wikia.com), and [this blog post](http://www.acwise.net/?p=2288) for a great primer.

Here's some of the Fireside work that is eligible for nomination:

First and foremost, please nominate our [\#BlackSpecFic](https://medium.com/fireside-fiction-company/blackspecfic-571c00033717#.f4dfesxrx) special report for the Best Related Work category. This is the most important and consequent thing we published last year, period.

Fireside Magazine is eligible for the [Best Semiprozine](http://semiprozine.org/semiprozine-directory/) award, and our editor, Brian J. White, is eligible for for the Best Editor Short Form award.

And finally, we have lots of contenders for your nominating pleasure in the Best Short Story category:
