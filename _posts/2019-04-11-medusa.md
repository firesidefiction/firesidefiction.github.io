a hundred angers sprouted from my head like snakes<br/>
it was not safe to cross the border<br/>
it was not safe to live like that<br/>

so I cut them off one by one<br/>
the anger of being bereft the anger of being alone<br/>
the anger of not being alone the anger of feeling alone while not being alone<br/>
the anger of losing my language the anger of language loosening its hold<br/>
the anger of stones the anger of blisters of parched lips<br/>
the anger of never feeling better the anger of medical trauma the anger of never measuring up – I snipped<br/>

anger after anger from my head and I wanted<br/>
to be pristine I wanted to feel clarity I wanted self-improvement I wanted a steady salary<br/>
I wanted to pass I wanted a place to live I wanted a place to hide<br/>
I wanted not to be bothered I wanted to be where it's quiet<br/>

they said this was a place of peace they said to wait for my anger to fall off on its own<br/>
they said there’s no reason to be angry they said calm down it's safe here and I<br/>
believed

I pushed from silence to speech<br/>
stitched old wounds that gave birth to my speech<br/>
threw out old words in the language that shaped me threw out old words in a language in which I refused myself<br/>
one by one my angers were shredded away<br/>
one by one the angers grew back<br/>

the anger of losing my way the anger of finding out how this country was shaped  <br/>
the anger of finding out where I was a thin layer of ground over stifled histories a thin layer of ground over mass graves<br/>
the anger of being afraid of darkness the anger of being afraid of large men of large dogs<br/>
the anger of being afraid the anger of being underpaid the anger of stalkers<br/>
the anger of my words that replaced the words I was trying to speak so tentatively in my own language<br/>

the anger of having the wrong name the anger of not having a name<br/>
the anger of wanting to leave the anger of having nowhere else to go the anger of wanting to belong<br/>

I could not speak anymore I forgot the voice I had found so laboriously<br/>
I cut the anger tendrils off<br/>
I cut and cut I cut until the anger was gone until I<br/>

stopped<br/>
and there was nothing<br/>

blessed silence where anger had been<br/>
fall leaves falling on the ground<br/>

for a few brief moments until<br/>

they caught up with me<br/>
crying we did not know crying we did not think it would get this bad<br/>
crying no more safe no more refuge crying terrified we did not know<br/>
disbelieving squinting at unlearned histories spilling from the earth<br/>
a hundred angers on their heads a thousand angers a hundred thousand angers an army of Medusas<br/>
snipping<br/>

and I felt<br/>
depleted I<br/>
no longer felt like anything<br/>
no anger, no voice, no speech, nothing<br/>
one step ahead<br/>
