Thanks for your submission.

Last year, we published a report called [#BlackSpecFic](https://medium.com/fireside-fiction-company/blackspecfic-571c00033717#.cpwlx160w), examining racism in short speculative ficiton publications. As part of our effort to address the exclusion of black writers, we are trying to get a sense of who is submitting to Fireside.

The data collected on this questionnaire is 100% anonymous--this form is completely separate from our submissions system, and won't be tied to your submissions at all.
