Thanks for your submission.

For the last two years, we've published a report called [#BlackSpecFic](https://firesidefiction.com/blackspecfic), examining racism in short speculative ficiton publications. As part of our effort to address the exclusion of black writers, we are trying to get a sense of who is submitting to Fireside.

The data collected on this questionnaire is 100% anonymousâ€”this form is completely separate from our submissions system, and won't be tied to your submissions at all.
