Emily Hope writes literary realism and fabulism, and her work so far has appeared in _CommuterLit_, _Fragmented Voices Magazine_, and _Page & Spine_. Her work often finds itself at the intersection of feminism and trauma, and she is interested in how women especially overcome and connect in spite of alienating circumstances. Emily is currently working on two novels about courageous girls, their twisted mother figures, and gruesome family secrets. Emily lives and works in NYC, and in her free time enjoys trying new foods and catching a movie at The Nitehawk.
