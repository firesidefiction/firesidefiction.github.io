Brent hails from the tree-swept hills of the Missouri Ozarks. He's spent a decade working in information technology by day and fiction by night. He loves speculative fiction and thrillers, and especially that place where the two genres collide. Brent lives with his wife, two daughters and terrifying guard dog. You can find him on his website at [dbbaldwin.com](http://www.dbbaldwin.com) and on Twitter as [@dbrentbaldwin](https://twitter.com/dbrentbaldwin).
