Mikki Kendall aspires to be an over-educated loudmouth with deep pockets. Failing that she manages to be a periodic cyborg who masquerades as a person with a spouse, kids, and all the trappings of quasi respectability. Once gainfully employed by an unnamed agency, she now invests her time in writing, wrangling jackasses on the internet, and telling people to go straight to hell. Raised by a family of cutthroat sarcastic assassins with magic powers, her obsession with history has led to her publishing weird stories, and articles about every serious issue under the sun. Her nonfiction work has appeared in the Washington Post, Time, Bitch Planet, and a host of other outlets including the anthology *Here We Are: Feminism For The Real World.* Her fiction work includes comics and short stories that are available via Revelator Magazine, Torquere Press, Dynamite Comics, and online, and she co-edited the Locus-nominated anthology *Hidden Youth.* She is a snatcher of all wigs, regardless of hair type.
