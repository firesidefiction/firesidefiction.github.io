Kate Sheeran Swed loves hot chocolate, plastic dinosaurs, and airplane tickets. She has trekked along the Inca Trail to Macchu Picchu, hiked on the Mýrdalsjökull glacier in Iceland, and climbed the ruins of Masada to watch the sunrise over the Dead Sea. After growing up in New Hampshire, she completed degrees in music at the University of Maine and Ithaca College, then moved to New York City. She currently lives in New York’s Capital Region with her husband, son, and two cats who were named after movie dogs (Benji and Beethoven).

Kate is the author of several science fiction novels, including the League of Independent Operatives series and the Toccata System novella trilogy. Her short fiction has appeared in the _Young Explorer’s Adventure Guide, Volume 5_, _Electric Spec_, _Daily Science Fiction_, and _Andromeda Spaceways_.
