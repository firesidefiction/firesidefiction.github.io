Andrea Speed writes way too much. She is the writer of the Infected series for Dreamspinner Press, the Josh of the Damned series for Riptide Publishing, and is Editor In Chief of CxPulp.com. She won a Rainbow Award for best horror/paranormal novel in 2012, and feels she may be ubiquitous on the web. But she is not (sadly) the Italian DJ of the same name that often comes up first in Google searches.
