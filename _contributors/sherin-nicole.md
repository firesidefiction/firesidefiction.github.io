Sherin Nicole might be a covert agent. Word on the street says the CIA offered her a scholarship (but that's classified). By day, she's an agent provocateur as chief creative officer for idobi Network. By night, she produces content for Geek Girl Riot. Formerly a paranormal romance writer (under her secret identities), she has three novels and several novellas. One of which was listed on Book Riot’s “100 Must-Read Romantic Comedies,” and another is _Bloody Fabulous_ (Prime Books, 2012). Culturally she’s half American, half British, and very southern—right down to the accent. Government reports show a residence in DC, but Sherin spends most of her time in the worlds she writes and she hopes to meet you there.
