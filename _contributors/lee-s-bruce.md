Lee S. Bruce is just a girl who dreamt of growing up to be an astronaut ... or a Stormtrooper. After passing the slightly less rigorous standards of the 501st Legion, she turned her attention to a different goal; non-fictional space exploration. In 2015, she began working with NASA on the James Webb Space Telescope in hopes of finding real galaxies, far, far away. Lee spends her spare time reading books and comics, playing video games, and binge-watching _Bob's Burgers_. She lives in Long Beach, California, near her two daughters and 6-month-old granddaughter. In an attempt to be the favorite grandparent, Lee is learning to play the _Moana_ soundtrack on guitar.
