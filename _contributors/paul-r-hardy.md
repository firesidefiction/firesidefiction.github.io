Paul R. Hardy lives in the UK with a coffee habit, a laptop, and various health problems. He works at a major NHS hospital, which is handy for the health problems, and writes speculative fiction for venues such as _Escape Pod_, _Diabolical Plots_, and _Deep Magic E-Zine_, as well as the fifth and sixth _Unidentified Funny Objects_ anthologies. He does not own any pets.
