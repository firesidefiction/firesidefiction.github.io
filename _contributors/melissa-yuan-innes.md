Melissa Yuan-Innes wrote this story in honour of Jacques Wong of Ho Ho BBQ and other under-recognized ethnic chefs. Melissa writes fantasy to escape from her job as an emergency doctor. Her publications include Writers of the Future, Nature, Tesseracts16, and the Aurora-winning anthology The Dragon and the Stars. Since no one can pronounce her name, she also writes medical thrillers under the pseudonym Melissa Yi. In her spare time, Melissa chases after two small children and one large Rottweiler.
