Takim Williams graduated from Princeton University in 2016 with a minor in creative writing. Founder and former editor-in-chief of _Figments_, Princeton’s campus publication for speculative fiction, Takim is the creator of the _#InContext_ blog for the Human Trafficking Institute. His debut novel, _The Experiment Himself_, is scheduled for release in late 2018 from Inkshares in partnership with Nerdist. Takim is searching for a version of Christian faith that is viable in the modern world. If the Rapture happens before the Singularity, he will ask for an extension.
