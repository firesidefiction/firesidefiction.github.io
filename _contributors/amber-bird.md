Amber Bird is a writer, a rockstar, and a science fiction simulacrum. Zie is the author of the hopepunk dystopian science fiction book _Peace Fire_, the front of post-punk/post-glam band Varnish, one half of transatlantic Autistic musical duo The Companions, and an unabashed geek. An Autistic introvert who found that music, books, and gaming saved zir in many ways throughout zir life, zie writes (books, poems, lyrics, blogs) and makes music in hopes of adding to someone else's escape or rescue. And, yes, zie was on that _Magic: The Gathering_ card.
