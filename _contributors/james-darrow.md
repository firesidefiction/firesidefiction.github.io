James Darrow is a science fiction and fantasy author from Washington state. After debuting his first solo piece, Blood in the Machine, at the end of 2013, he took an overly long hiatus from actively working on new projects. After waking up and realizing that all the stories in his head wouldn't be put to the page unless he started writing again, he began working on future projects. His current line-up of future works is a science fiction and fantasy crossover novel along with a compilation of short stories and pieces of flash fiction.
