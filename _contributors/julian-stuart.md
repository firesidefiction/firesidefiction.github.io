Julian Stuart is, according to a wide variety of sources, a writer.

Julian was raised in Canada and exported for the Australian market. They live mostly in front of a keyboard, with their husband and dog, who remind them to go outside sometimes, and enjoy black tea, starlight, absurdism, sus2 chords, old book smell, and the word quirk.

Ironically, they have a great phone voice.
