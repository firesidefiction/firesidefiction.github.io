Julian Stuart is, according to a wide variety of sources, a writer.
Julian was raised in Canada and exported for the Australian market. They live mostly in front of a keyboard, and enjoy black tea, starlight, absurdism, sus2 chords, old book smell, and the word _quirk._
They will not sing at you unless you ask nicely.
Their work has been published in _Fireside Magazine_ (Issue 92, June 2021), _Xenocultivars: Stories of Queer Growth_ (Speculatively Queer, 2022), and _Hundred Word Horror: Rock Band_ (Ghost Orchid Press, 2021), and on all major ebook retailers.
