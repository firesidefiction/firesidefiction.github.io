Jordan Taylor grew up in a small town in the American South, where she was raised on equal parts Jesus and fairy tales. She currently lives in Brooklyn with her husband, Kenan, and their corgi, Ein, where she spends too much money in bookstores and drinks copious amounts of tea. You can follow her online at [jordanrtaylor.com](http://jordanrtaylor.com/).
