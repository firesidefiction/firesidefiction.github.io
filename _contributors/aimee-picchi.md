Her stories have appeared in publications including _Intergalactic Medicine Show_, _Flash Fiction Online_, and _Daily Science Fiction_. She’s a graduate of the Viable Paradise workshop. Aimee is a former classical musician, and is a graduate of Juilliard Pre-College and the Eastman School of Music, where she played the viola. She enjoys a good viola joke, but warns you she's heard them all.
