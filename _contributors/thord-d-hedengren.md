Thord D. Hedengren is addicted to words, and the stories they make. He writes fiction, short and long, as well as freelance articles and columns for various media outlets. He's a renowned web developer and designer, and the author of SMASHING WORDPRESS: BEYOND THE BLOG and THE WRITER'S IPAD, among other techy things. You'll find him wasting away on Twitter as [@tdh](https://twitter.com/tdh), or writing about just about anything at [tdh.me](http://tdh.me). Thord lives in Sweden, the Land of Kings.
