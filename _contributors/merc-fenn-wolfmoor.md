Merc Rustad](https://mercfennwolfmoor.com/2019/07/01/the-names-we-choose-for-ourselves), is a queer nonbinary writer who likes dinosaurs, robots, monsters, and cookies. Their stories have appeared in _Lightspeed Magazine_, _Apex Magazine_, _Uncanny Magazine_, _Shimmer Magazine_, _Nightmare Magazine_, and others. Merc is also a 2016 Nebula Award finalist for their story "This Is Not A Wardrobe Door," which has been reprinted in _PodCastle_ (audio), _Cicada Magazine_ (2018), and _The Best American Science Fiction and Fantasy 2017_, along with translations into Chinese and Portuguese.
