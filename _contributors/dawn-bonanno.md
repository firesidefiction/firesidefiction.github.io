Dawn Bonanno suffers from an obsession with pens, paper and fixing things, so it only makes sense that she writes stories. She wrote her first story at the age of six on the back of Eastern Airlines luggage tags and has been writing ever since. Rumor has it she doesn't know how to stop. When she isn't torturing characters, you'll find her cooking, baking, running, cycling and spending time with her family. When her feline overlords allow, she blogs about her writing journey at [www.dmbonanno.com](https://dmbonanno.com/)
