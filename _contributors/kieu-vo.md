Artist by trade, and storyteller at heart, Kieu Vo wields pen to tablet to create illustrations that strive to engage and evoke emotions. A lover of colors, and all things that glitter, she finds excuses to illuminate every artwork with light. When not working for a client, she’s toiling away on her personal webcomic.
