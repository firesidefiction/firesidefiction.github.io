Allison Mulder grew up in various small Midwestern towns and a sizable swath of the internet. She writes fantasy, science fiction, and—often by accident—horror. Her fiction has appeared in _Escape Pod_, _InterGalactic Medicine Show_, _Crossed Genres_, and more. With patience, sensitive equipment, and ample provisions, you can sometimes glimpse Allison at [allisonmulder.wordpress.com](https://allisonmulder.wordpress.com/). Or, track her far more easily on Twitter at [@AMulderWrites](https://twitter.com/AMulderWrites), where she broadcasts any significant life happenings, gushes over her current fictional obsessions, and uses far too many X-Files gifs.
