Over the past fifteen years, Virginia M. Mohlere has emerged infrequently from her fort built of yarn and fountain pens to publish works in venues such as _Mythic Delirium Magazine_, _Goblin Fruit_, and _Strange Horizons_. She can be found on Twitter (@virginiamohlere), if you don't mind cussing and Texas politics.
