Satu Kettunen is a Helsinki based illustrator working with bold colour palette and gentle humour. Her study background includes BA in both Art Education and Fashion design. She was awarded Rudolf Koivu prize in 2015, Tiiliskivi prize in 2016 and nominated for The Nordic Council Children and Young People’s Literature Prize in 2017 for her illustrations in picture books. She gets all excited about street art, collects beautiful picture books and loves biking. Her dream is to one day have a garden of her own.
