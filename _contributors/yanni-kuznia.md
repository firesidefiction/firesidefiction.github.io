Yanni Kuznia is a lifelong bibliophile who grew up wanting to be in comic book movies. She is a classically trained actress, a Russian and Crusades historian, went to stunt school in Toronto, runs 5k and 10k races, and picked up watercolor painting after deciding to finish her eldest's aborted paint-by-number attempt. Yanni is currently working her dream job as COO and Managing Editor of Subterranean Press.
