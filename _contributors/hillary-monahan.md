Hillary Monahan is the critically acclaimed NYT bestselling author of the _Mary: The Summoning_ series for Disney-Hyperion, among other titles. She lives in southeastern Massachusetts with her family of some parts humans, some parts fur kids. She's a feminist, a queer advocate, and a professional gloom cookie who can (and will) recite _Young Frankenstein_ from memory for you if you ask nicely.
