When Eric Francis was 10, this movie called "Star Wars" came out; he saw it 12 times during its original run and the opening bars of the theme still give him chills. As soon as he can get his hands on a functioning X-Wing and light saber, he will begin a new career as a Jedi. Until then, he will continue to write fiction, keep bees, and work as a journalist in Arkansas. You can reliably find him at [Facebook.com/DogtownWriter](http://Facebook.com/DogtownWriter)
