M. E. Owen, writes crime, science fiction, and fantasy — often in the same story. Her short work has appeared in _Fiction River_, _Abyss & Apex_, _Flash Fiction Online_ and elsewhere. She’s currently working on her debut novel, a noir mystery set against a hard science fiction backdrop (or maybe it's the other way around). You can find her at [MEOwen.com](http://MEOwen.com).
