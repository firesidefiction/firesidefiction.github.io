Jessica has been making art—be it word, performance, or fiber—on and off since adolescence. She has been working in or around theatermaking for over ten years and her favorite offstage job was probably making puppets. When not writing, reading, sewing, or knitting, she is either performing under an assumed name wearing a lot of glitter, marathoning television series, or cuddling one of her critters (husband included).
