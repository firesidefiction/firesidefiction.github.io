Krystal Claxton writes speculative fiction in the sliver of time between raising a three-year-old with her wonderful husband and being a full-time computer technician. She enjoys attending Dragon*Con in costume, science magazines, and feverishly researching whichever random topic has just piqued her interest. Keep up with her at [krystalclaxton.wordpress.com](http://krystalclaxton.wordpress.com) or @krystalclaxton on Twitter.
