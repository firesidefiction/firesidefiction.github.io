**Sabrina Vourvoulias** is an award-winning Latina journalist whose work has appeared at PRI’s _The World_, _The Guardian US_, _Philly.com_ and _Philadelphia Magazine_, among others.
After years of adhering to AP style, and juggling the conventions of English- and Spanish-language journalism, she turned to speculative fiction. Her short fiction has appeared at _Uncanny Magazine_, _Tor.com_, _Strange Horizons_, _GUD Magazine_, _Crossed Genres_, and upcoming in _Apex Magazine_, as well as in numerous anthologies.
She is also the author of _Ink_, a near-future, immigration-centered dystopia which draws on her memories of Guatemala's armed internal conflict, and of the Latinx experience in the United States. It was named to Latinidad’s Best Books of 2012, and was reissued by Rosarium Publishing in September 2018.
