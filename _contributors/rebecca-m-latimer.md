Rebecca M. Latimer is a Canadian writer of speculative fiction and a self-taught traditional artist. Her lifelong exile to a wintry, snow-covered realm without magic remains a mystery even to her. For now, she subsists on tea and dreams. Find more of her work at [rebeccamlatimer.com](http://rebeccamlatimer.com) or on Twitter [@RebeccaMLatimer](https://twitter.com/RebeccaMLatimer).
