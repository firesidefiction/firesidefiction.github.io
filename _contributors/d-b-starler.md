D.B. Starler writes all sorts of things, in between chasing her children around their small section of North Carolina and drinking copious amounts of Coke Zero. The stories run the gamut from urban fantasy to historical romance, and they almost always include smooching.  Please follow D.B.Starler on Twitter as @DBStarler. She's also on Twitter, Facebook, Goodreads, Pinterest and Google+ as her best-selling, historical romance writing alter ego, Olivia Kelly.
