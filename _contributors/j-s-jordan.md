J. S. Jordan is an artist, poet, and student living in the Chapel Hill area. They grew up in the rural Appalachian mountains of western North Carolina and still return there frequently to hike, camp, and unwind. Their inspiration for writing is always to reach out to others and express things that the reader may find difficult to say for themselves.
