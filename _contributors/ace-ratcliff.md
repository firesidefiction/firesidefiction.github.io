Ace Tilton Ratcliff is an amorphous cloud of genderless rage currently living and working in Boynton Beach, Florida. They live with their husband, Derek, and a pack of wild beastlings that definitely all think they're people. They live with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, endometriosis, and a whole slew of other medical issues, which means much of their time is focused on disability justice activism.

When not yelling about inaccessibility, they work as a freelancer. They wield a mean paintbrush but love to work in mixed mediums. They like to spend time in front of and behind the camera, especially if the photograph involves their wheelchair, Candypop. On top of everything else, they’re also the co-founder of an in-home pet euthanasia veterinary practice called Harper’s Promise, so named for their pup Harper Laika Leeloo, who died in 2017.

Ace’s writing has been previously published in _Uncanny Magazine_’s “Disabled People Destroy Science Fiction” issue, as well as by _HuffPost_, _io9_, Narratively, _Catapult Magazine_, _The Establishment_, Bitch Media, and elsewhere. Their work can be seen at their website, stayweirdbekind.com. When not reading, they’re probably tweeting at @mortuaryreport. Nihil De Nobis, Sine Nobis (Nothing About Us, Without Us).
