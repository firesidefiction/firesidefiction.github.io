Ace Ratcliff is a disabled, nonbinary writer, artist, photographer, and model who lives and works in Oakland, California. Much of her work centers on intersectional feminism, with a specific focus on disability justice. She lives with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, dysautonomia, and mast cell activation syndrome, which all make for a particularly rebellious meatcage. She is a former mortician who co-owns Harper’s Promise, an in-home pet euthanasia, hospice, and palliative care service with her fiance, Derek. She can almost always be found with a dog by her side. She tweets [@MortuaryReport](www.twitter.com/mortuaryreport).
