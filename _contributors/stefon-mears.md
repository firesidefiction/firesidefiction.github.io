Stefon Mears occasionally asks his cats questions, but their answers are unreliable. Stefon earned his M.F.A. in Creative Writing from N.I.L.A., and his B.A. in Religious Studies (double emphasis in Ritual and Mythology) from U.C. Berkeley. To date Stefon has published about a score of short pieces and two novels, Magician's Choice and Surviving Telepathy. Look for him online at [stefonmears.com, text](http://www.stefonmears.com), on GooglePlus, or [@stefonmears ](http://www.twitter.com/stefonmears) on Twitter.
