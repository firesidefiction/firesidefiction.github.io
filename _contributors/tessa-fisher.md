Tessa Fisher is a happily married PhD candidate and possibly the world's only openly trans lesbian astrobiologist. When she's not doing science, her hobbies include burlesque dancing, singing in her city's LGBTQIA women's chorus, running, and writing LGBTQIA-positive science fiction and fantasy. She and her wife reside in Phoenix, AZ, along with a fairly aloof bearded dragon. Her works have been featured in _Vulture Bones_, as well as the upcoming _Rosalind's Siblings_ anthology from Galli Books and the _Glass and Gardens: Solarpunk Winters_ anthology from WorldWeaver Press.
