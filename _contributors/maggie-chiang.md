Maggie Chiang is a Taiwanese American full-time artist and part-time dreamer. Inspired by both places real and fictitious, Maggie's illustrations evoke a longing for adventure and the pursuit of the unknown, exploring impossible landscapes and places unseen. A central theme of her art is the relationship between humanity and nature, oftentimes the underlying thread that ties together her work and establishes her individual artistic voice. Clients include The New York Times, Washington Post, Johns Hopkins, BuzzFeed, and others.
