Martin Cahill lives in New York, just outside that sprawling metropolis everyone's always talking about. Bookseller by day, bartender by night, freelancer at all other times, he writes whenever he can. Every so often he remembers that sleep is important. Other fiction of his can be found at Nightmare Magazine. He is thrilled to be attending the Clarion Writers' Workshop this summer in San Diego, and can be found online at <a href="http://martintcahill.wordpress.com">martintcahill.wordpress.com</a> and on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/McflyCahill90">@McflyCahill90</a>. Tweet him about craft beer, books, or Locke &amp; Key and you'll most likely become fast friends.
