Don Rimx’s unparalleled artistry sets him apart from the rest. As a classically trained fine artist, graffitist, grand scale muralist and new school tattoo artist, Don does it all.  Originally from the beautiful island of Puerto Rico, he moved to Brooklyn in 2009 and is now living in sunny Florida. City life had a profound effect on his works of art.  Through the use of intricate lines, wood and brick elements and rich color treatments, Don Rimx has comprised breathtaking skeletal structures exploring the synthesis of man and his city.
