Calley Odum is a children's librarian from Alaska, and as such is only too comfortable with the cold, the dark, and things that go _chomp_. She and her partner live in Oregon, where they craft crafts, game games, and write when the stars align. Her work can be found in _Allegory Magazine_ and _All World's Wayfarer_.
