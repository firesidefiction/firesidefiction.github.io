Dora Klindžić is a writer, game developer, and astrophysicist (not necessarily in that order) hailing from the Republic of Croatia. Her nonfiction has been featured on gender and media culture websites, and her speculative fiction has appeared in _Clarkesworld Magazine_. She is also a graduate of the Clarion West class of 2018. You can find her in the Netherlands doing research on deep-space tracking of spacecraft, developing an instrument for the Moon, and more. When she's not building rockets, she's building worlds.
