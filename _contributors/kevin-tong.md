Kevin Tong learned to draw in the competitive world of underground illustration, where clients often used knife fight challenges to get out of paying him. Nevertheless, he prevailed and from that wood chipper furnace life his savage illustration style was forged. Since taking it to the streets, Kevin has been steadily illustrating since 2005. He currently lives and works in Austin, TX.
