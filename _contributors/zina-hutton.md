Back when she was a child, Zina Hutton jumped out of a window to escape dance class in the Virgin Islands. Now she's an aspiring fantasy writer who tends to leap headfirst into new stories and worlds the second that inspiration strikes. Zina lives in hot and humid South Florida and she's never far away from a notebook and her precious Kindle.  You can find her at [Stitch's Media Mix](https://stitchmediamix.wordpress.com/) and on twitter as [@stichomancery](https://twitter.com/stichomancery).
