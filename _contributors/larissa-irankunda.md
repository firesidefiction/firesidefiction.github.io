Larissa Irankunda is a Burundian American writer, actress, and film buff based in Atlanta, GA. She’s an alumnus of the 2018 THREAD at Yale program, and works as the editor In chief for Quirktastic: a friendship app and media company for “geeks, gamers, and nerds.”
When she’s not writing, Larissa enjoys collecting vinyls, attending comic conventions, and fangirling over Jeff Goldblum. Larissa’s work — both fiction and nonfiction — focuses heavily on Afrofuturism, fringe culture, feminism, and the ever-changing nuances of the Black experience.
