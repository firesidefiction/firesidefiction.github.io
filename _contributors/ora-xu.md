**Ora Xu** (Ziqi Xu) is a California-based Chinese illustrator and painter. She uses a highly saturated palette of chromatic color in her delighted illustrations. Cute and strange at the same time, her style fits in a wide range of contexts. She got her unique style from her mixed background working in various fields. She has published two award-winning children's books and is currently working with an indie game company. She eats chocolate when her hands are free from painting.
