Kevin has always been interested in how things sound. Imitating things at a young age led people to suggest becoming the voice in the movies and commercial he imitated all the time. He thought it would be easy to do, but only after 3 years of training has he been able to reach the level of a high-performing voice actor.
​
Kevin's voice has been featured in projects ranging from colonoscopy tests for patients of a local hospital to video games played around the whole world.
