Ryan Van Loan is an up-and-coming science fiction and fantasy author. Ryan served six years as a Sergeant in the United States Army Infantry (PA National Guard), where he served on the front lines of the war in Afghanistan. Ryan has traveled around the world with his wife, wandering Caribbean island haunts, exploring the palaces and cathedrals of Europe, and hiking with elephants in the rainforests of Southeast Asia. When he’s not traveling, Ryan enjoys hiking, soccer (football), tabletop gaming, weightlifting, and all things culinary. Ryan's debut novel, _The Sin in the Steel_, came out in 2020 from Tor Books and is the first in The Fall of the Gods series. Today, Ryan lives in northeastern Pennsylvania with his wife and two dogs, where he’s hard at work on his next novel.
