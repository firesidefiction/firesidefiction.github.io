Chris Butera is a Chicago native, part-time Los Angeleno, and current Londoner. His fiction has been featured in dubious anthologies and he’s responsible for a nearly unseen webisode of SyFy Television’s Helix. He once thwarted an attempt to steal Ray Bradbury’s hair and send it to Mars. Chris is currently studying in City, University of London’s Creative Writing program working on his first novel.
