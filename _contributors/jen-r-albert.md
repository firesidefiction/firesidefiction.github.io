Jen R Albert uses her day-job as an entomologist as a cover for her moonlight obsession with writing speculative fiction. In stolen moments she reads any and all science fiction and fantasy literature she can get a hold of and even plays the occasional video game. Jen lives in Toronto with her husband and one very large, very hairy German Shepherd. Find her on Twitter [@jenralbert](https://twitter.com/jenralbert)
