Laura Lovic-Lindsay was the grateful recipient of the PennWriters' Conference Poetry Prize in 2014. She has had short stories and poems published at WritersWeekly.com, WritersType.com, Boston Literary Magazine, and the inaugural issue of Fine Linen. She lives and writes in an old farmhouse in Western Pennsylvania, but spends her days walking through places that don't exist.
