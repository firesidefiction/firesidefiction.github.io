Based out of the greater Philadelphia area, I'm a senior level toymaker, creative director, identity/packaging designer, illustrator, and brand / line developer for stellar companies such as Crayola, Disney, Hasbro, Mattel, MEGA Brands, Jakks Pacific, Nylabone, Kathy Davis Studios, WeVeel / Scentos and more for over 18 years. My work has taken me to Hong Kong, California, Florida, NYC (and NYC and NYC...) and back again.

My illustration work has been featured in licensed products, publishing, games, and children's toys and publishing. Clients include TED talks, the American Library Association, Fireside Magazine, Galileo Games, Evil Hat Productions, Cryptozoic Entertainment, New York Times bestselling authors Catherynne M. Valente and Chuck Wendig, and more.

Dislikes: The words "safe" and "impossible". Likes: Trail running, crisp eyeliner, indie-games, dragon boat racing, new adventures with my family. Also, I enjoy drawing whenever possible, and often when impractical.
