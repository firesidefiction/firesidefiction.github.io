Sarah Goslee is a cyborg, a mad scientist, and a string enthusiast. She writes about all of those things, often in less than 140 characters as [@phiala](https:/twitter.com/phiala), and in rather more than 140 at [sarahgoslee.com](http://www.sarahgoslee.com). She spends a lot of time kayaking in central Pennsylvania, and this story is entirely true.
