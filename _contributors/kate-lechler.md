Kate Lechler’s work has appeared in _Shimmer Magazine_, _PodCastle_, and _Kaleidotrope_, and previously here in _Fireside Magazine_, among other places. She teaches British literature at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Miss., where she lives with her dog, Charlie. When she’s not working on her next novel (_Moby Dick_ with magical kraken), there's a good chance you'll find her in the tub or in the woods... which she has not yet haunted.
