**Sheree Renée Thomas** is a Memphis-based award-winning short fiction writer, poet, and editor whose "black pot mojo" creative work explores ordinary people facing extraordinary circumstances. She is the author of _Sleeping Under the Tree of Life_ (Aqueduct Press), honored with a Publishers Weekly Starred Review and longlisted for the 2016 James Tiptree, Jr. Award, and of _Shotgun Lullabies_ (2011), described as "a revelatory work like Jean Toomer’s _Cane_." Thomas edited the _Dark Matter_ black speculative fiction volumes that won two World Fantasy Awards. She has been awarded fellowships from Bread Loaf Environmental, the Millay Colony of the Arts, VCCA, Blue Mountain Center, Art Omi/Ledig House, the New York Foundation of the Arts, and the Tennessee Arts Commission. Her work appears in numerous anthologies and literary journals, including _FIYAH Literary Magazine_, _Apex Magazine_, _Strange Horizons_, _Memphis Noir_, _So Long Been Dreaming: Postcolonial Science Fiction & Fantasy_, _Stories for Chip_, _Revise the Psalm_, _Jalada_, _An Alphabet of Embers_, _The Ringing Ear_, _Ghost-Fishing: An Eco-Justice Poetry Anthology_, _Blacktasticon_, _Mojo: Conjure Stories_, _Mojo Rising_, _Callaloo_, and _Harvard’s Transition_. She is the Associate Editor of _Obsidian: Literature & Arts in the African Diaspora_ (Illinois State University, Normal) and the founder of BSAM Memphis, a festival held in the historic South Main Arts District that celebrates Afrofuturism art, music, artivism, and scholarship.
