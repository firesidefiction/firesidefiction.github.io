Frances Rowat lives in Ontario with her husband and a not-quite-startling number of cats. She was born in Canada, and while growing up spent time in England, Algeria, and Switzerland. She is currently spending nearly all of her time behind a keyboard, where she frequently gets lost in details. Her work has appeared in such venues as _Lady Churchill’s Rosebud Wristlet_, _Liminal Stories_, and _Cossmass Infinities_. She enjoys knitting, rain, and post-apocalyptic settings.
