Mimi Mondal is a Dalit woman who writes about politics and history, occasionally camouflaged as fiction. She holds three masters’ degrees for no reason but pure joy. Mimi was formerly Poetry and Reprint Editor at _Uncanny Magazine_, and her first anthology, _Luminescent Threads: Connections to Octavia Butler_, was published in 2017. She lives in New York, tweets from [@Miminality](https://twitter.com/miminality), doesn't very often hang out at [mimimondal.com](https://mimimondal.com/), and always enjoys the company of monsters.
