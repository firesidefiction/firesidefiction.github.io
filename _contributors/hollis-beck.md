Hollis Beck is a versatile character actress with experience in theater and voice over and a passion for stories well told. Her credits include an undergraduate training experience at NYU Tisch's Playwrights Horizons Theater School, improv at the People's Improv Theater (NYC), and previous work with companies including Undiscovered Countries, GB Patch Games and FUNimation.

As a playwright, Hollis crafts narratives about queer identity, found families, and people who try very hard. Her latest play I Love You, Vivian James was an O'Neill National Playwrights Conference semi-finalist (2020).

Hollis loves cooking, video games and a good latte. She hopes you enjoy her work and would love to see yours.
