John F. Gardner lives in Warsaw, Indiana, a small town you've never heard of that controls whether or not you can get replacement bones. He has a wife, two sons, a cat, and a snake. He tries to post one snarky thing a day to Twitter. Follow him [@wombatdeamor](https://twitter.com/wombatdeamor). This is his first professional sale.
