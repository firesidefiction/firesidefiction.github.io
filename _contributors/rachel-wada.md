Rachel Wada was born in Japan, grew up briefly in Hong Kong and China, and now lives and works in Vancouver. She graduated with a BFA in Illustration from Emily Carr University of Art and Design in 2016. Her illustrative style is characterized by rich textures, colours, and details executed both traditionally and digitally. She is shortlisted for the Pacific Northwest Book Award for her children’s book debut, _The Phonebooth in Mr. Hirota’s Garden_, written by Heather Smith (Orca Book Publishers). Rachel’s work can also be found in newspapers, magazines, and online publications.
