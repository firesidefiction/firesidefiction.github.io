K. C. Alexander is the author of _Necrotech_—a transhumanist sci-fi called “a speed freak rush” by NYT bestseller Richard Kadrey and “a violent thrillride” by award-nominated Stephen Blackmoore. She co-wrote _Mass Effect: Andromeda: Nexus Uprising_ with _NYT_ bestseller Jason M. Hough, Bioware’s first novelization for Mass Effect: Andromeda. Other credits consist of short stories to Fireside magazine and a contribution to _Geeky Giving_. Specialties include voice-driven prose, imperfect characters, and reckless profanity. Also, creative ways to murder the deserving—in fiction. Probably. She champions mental health awareness and prefers animals to people. And she writes anything she wants to.
