**Layla Al-Bedawi** is a writer of fiction, poetry, and experimental hybrid work, a language and writing instructor, community builder, occasional podcaster, and frequent bookbinder (among other things). English is her third language, but she's been dreaming in it for years. Her work is published or forthcoming in _Strange Horizons_, _Bayou Magazine_, _Winter Tangerine_, _Juked_, _Liminal Stories_, _Mithila Review_, and elsewhere. Born in Germany to Kurdish and Ukrainian parents, she now lives in Houston, TX, where she co-founded Fuente Collective, an organization focused on experimentation, collaboration, and hybridity in writing and other arts. She is currently working on a collection of interconnected flash fiction. Find her on Twitter under [@frauleinlayla](https://www.twittercom/frauleinlayla) and at [laylaalbedawi.com](http:///www.laylaalbedawi.com).
