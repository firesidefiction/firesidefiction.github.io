Hesper Leveret is a speculative fiction writer whose work emphasizes the beautiful, lyrical, and strange. She was born and raised in Southampton, then read Ancient & Modern History at Balliol College, Oxford. She has done a variety of jobs including SEO writing, project management, procurement, writing questions for the TV quiz shows _Mastermind_ and _The Weakest Link_, and selling books in Waterstone's.
She lived for several years in Derby, where she enjoyed exploring the Peak District but missed living near the sea. She is now based in Liverpool, UK, where she lives with her rock-climbing husband, two young sons, and chronic pain. Her science fiction story "We Who Are Left On This Dying Earth" appears in the June 2021 edition of _Luna Station Quarterly_. Since September 2020, she has been a slush reader for _Apex Magazine_.
