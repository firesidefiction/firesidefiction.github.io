Rob McMonigal is a freelance writer and tutor, recently relocated to Portland, Oregon. He manages the indie-focused comic book blog [Panel Patter](http://www.panelpatter.com), and modeled the character in this story after one of his creator friends--don't ask him which one! A fan of the speculative in all its forms (prose, comics, and film), he grew up on the Three Stooges, Spider-Man, Ray Bradbury, and Universal Horror films. (Explains a lot, right?) Rob lives with his wife, fellow writer Erica Satifka, and entirely too many cats. You can reach him on Twitter [@rob_mcmonigal](http://www.twitter.com/@rob_mcmonigal)
