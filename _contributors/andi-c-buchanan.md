Andi C. Buchanan lives among streams and faultlines, surrounded by books and robotic insects. Winner of a Sir Julius Vogel Award for their recent story "Girls Who Do Not Drown", their fiction has been published in _Apex Magazine_, _Kaleidotrope_, _GlitterShip_, and more, and their editing recognised on the Otherwise/Tiptree Award Honor List. In their spare time, they like to sample cheese, open doors for the cat, and promote the interests of the space-lobster multitudes.
