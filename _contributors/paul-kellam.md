Paul is a freelance illustrator based in Florida, where he strives to create work that paints characters of color in a fantastical rhythm, overlaid with juicy hue vibrations. Having developed a passion for the arts early on, he continued to harness and develop his creative skills until attaining his Bachelor’s in Media arts and Animation. Upon graduating, he chose to direct his skills towards digital illustration and designing fun and expressive characters, more frequently in the form of children’s books and album covers. Paul often finds his muses through nature, color, music, and fashion, as well as the people he’s held dear.  x
