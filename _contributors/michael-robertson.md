Michael Robertson writes science fiction and fantasy stories while holding down a job at a non-profit. His stories tend to feature people, including lovable non-humans, trying to do the right thing. Studying ethical criticism while getting a Masters degree in English Literature developed his interest in such questions (both the ethical questions and matters of portraying them in fiction). From his point of view the world could stand more ethics (and/or more criticism), particularly in the area of C-level executives and Republican politicians, so when he is not writing (and not holding down his job), he works on political efforts, dreaming one day to create a luxury space-communist utopia. He lives and works in New York City, and his writing has appeared in anthologies published by Zombies Need Brains and Parsec Ink, and in two issues of _Cockroach Conservatory_.
