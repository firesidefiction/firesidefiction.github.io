Manuel J. Iniesta was born in Andújar, Spain. Ever since he was born, he's had a pencil in his hand, so it was natural for him to study art. He studied in Jaén, at the José Nogué Art School. After he finished his studies, he started doing exhibitions in Andalusia (Jaén, Córdoba, Málaga, without forgetting his hometown). Hid path took him to Málaga, where he currently works as a fashion illustrator, editorial illustrator, and tattoo artist, and although his path has only just begun, he plans to dedicate every last drop of his ink to this profession.
