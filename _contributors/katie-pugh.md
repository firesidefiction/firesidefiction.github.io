Katie Pugh is a local writer in Pittsburgh, PA, where she lives with her husband. Born and raised in Virginia, Katie moved northward after graduating from college in search of excitement and snow (she figures one out of two is pretty good). She pens urban fantasy and "strange" fiction. Her writing has been featured in Moon Magazine, Every Day Fiction, Airplane Reading, The Shortest Fiction and Gadchick.com.
