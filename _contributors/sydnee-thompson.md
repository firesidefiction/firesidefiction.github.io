Sydnee Thompson is a speculative fiction writer whose bylines include _FIYAH Literary Magazine of Black Speculative Fiction_, _Fireside Magazine_, and io9. In addition to her short fiction, she is currently drafting a fantasy novel about queer POC trying to avoid killing each other and falling in love, in that order, while accidentally saving the world from malevolent gods. When not writing fiction, she spends her time playing JRPGS, watching anime, taking naps, and working as a copy editor. You can find her other work on her website, [shadesofsydnee.com](http://shadesofsydnee.com).
