Sangeetha Thanapal's high school teacher told her mother to stop her from reading so much; it didn't work. The reading turned into writing, which then turned into her whole life. Besides fantasy, she also writes nonfiction on subjects ranging from racial justice to the politics of Southeast Asia. She is best known for coining the term "Chinese Privilege" to explain racism in Singapore and runs a blog producing resources on all things social justice. She is presently working on her first novel, _We, The South_, an epic fantasy adventure set in medieval India. When not absorbed in her reading and writing, she likes to blog about home decor. You can find her everywhere as @kaliandkalki.
