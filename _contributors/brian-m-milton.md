Brian Milton is a short, tweedy Glaswegian who splits his time between work, writing, and flapping at wildlife. He'd like to do less of two of these. Brian lives with his wife, a cat, and thousands of bees. The cat rarely talks to him. He has been published in anthologies such as _Caledonia Dreamin'_ and _Thirty Years of Rain_, and in magazines such as _KZine_ and this here wonderful _Fireside Magazine_. He can be found shouting on the twitters at [@munchkinstein](https://www.twitter.com/muchkinstein).
