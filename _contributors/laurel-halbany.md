Laurel Halbany talked an otherwise sensible college into granting her a bachelor's degree in Mythology, which has proven to be useful both in writing and in winning bets at parties over whose undergraduate degree is the least practical. Her work has been published in English and in translation in Japanese, and has appeared in publications including Night Land magazine and In the Court of the Yellow King. She lives in the urban penumbra of San Francisco.
