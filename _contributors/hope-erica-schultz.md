Hope Erica Schultz writes Science Fiction and Fantasy (and very, very rarely horror) YA and New Adult stories and novels (except when it's middle grade or for adults.) When not reading, writing, tramping through the woods, or pretending to be someone else, she keeps busy at 1 1/2 jobs, a happily chaotic family, one dog, four cats, and a flock of wild turkeys who think they own the back yard. Follow her on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/hope.schultz.14) and at [her website](http://tlenajade.wix.com/hope-erica-schultz) website.
