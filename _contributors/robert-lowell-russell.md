Robert Lowell Russell, a native Texan, lives with his family in southeastern Ohio. He is a former librarian and current nursing school student. He once aspired to be a history professor, but found writing about the real world too constraining. Rob likes to write about all sorts of things, frequently including action and humor in his work. Not satisfied with writing stories of questionable content for adults, he's also working on series of middle school books incorporating his love of not-so-super-heroes and toilet-humor.
