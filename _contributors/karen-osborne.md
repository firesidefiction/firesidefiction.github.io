**Karen Osborne** lives in Baltimore with two violins, an autoharp, four cameras, a husband and a bonkers orange cat. She’s been a reporter, a wedding videographer, a newspaper photographer, a high school English teacher, a Starfleet captain and a Scottish fiddler. Her short fiction currently appears at _Escape Pod_ and is forthcoming in _Beneath Ceaseless Skies_. She is a graduate of Viable Paradise and the Clarion Writers’ Workshop, and while she hasn’t yet climbed the mountain herself, she keeps on staring at the skies. Karen can be found on Twitter at @karenthology and at [karenosborne.com](http://www.karenosborne.com).
