C. C. S. Ryan likes stories in which the princess gets the girl and stories in which the mad scientist looks nothing like what you get when you google the phrase "mad scientist." Or even better, stories that do both at the same time. She keeps sabotaging her never-ending quest to achieve a reasonable ratio of books to bookshelves by buying more books.Â You can follow her on Twitter at [@wintersweet](https://twitter.com/wintersweet)
