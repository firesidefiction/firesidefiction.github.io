Rebecca Burton is a queer, neurodivergent writer from the UK who disappears into the fantasy worlds in her head to distract herself from helping people complete their tax returns. She has previously sold short fiction to _Abyss & Apex Magazine_, but this is only her second sale, so she is wildly overexcited on main. When not writing, she can be found on Twitter at @TyGrammarRex, muttering about hair dye, pottery, and K-drama.
