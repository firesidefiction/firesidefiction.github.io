Taimur Ahmad is an environmental advocate and rock climber. He is part of the Clarion West class of 2016 and received the 2017 Dell Award. Born and raised in New York City, Taimur currently lives in the small town of Bishop, CA, in the eastern Sierra Nevada range. The “green tunnels” of the story are the deep green forests of the Shawangunk and Catskill mountains in upstate New York, where Taimur first learned about the magic of the natural world.
