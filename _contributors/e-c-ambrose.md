E. C. Ambrose is the author of "The Dark Apostle" historical fantasy series about a medieval barber surgeon launched July 2013 with _Elisha Barber_ from DAW books, and continuing with _Elisha Magus_ July 2014 . Library Journal's starred review described _Elisha Barbe_ as "painfully elegant, beautifully told." The author blogs about the intersections between history and fantasy at [ecambrose.wordpress.com](http://ecambrose.wordpress.com/) and can also be found at  [www.theDarkApostle.com](http://www.thedarkapostle.com/) or on facebook/ECAmbroseauthor.  E. C. spends too much time in a tiny office in New England with a mournful black lab lurking under the desk.
