Chelle Parker ("she" or "they" pronouns, Mx.) is a nerdy, queer, nonbinary, neuroatypical, disabled thirtysomething and has enjoyed an unusually colourful life, having lived in or visited fourteen countries on four continents and learned seven languages along the way. Chelle’s background is primarily in education, where they spent eight years teaching English, French, math, science, and life skills to at-risk junior-high students, but they’ve also worked in a peculiar array of other environments. These range from daycares to sexual health clinics, doing jobs as diverse as librarian, baker, radio DJ, and Braille transcriptionist, all while editing on the side.

These days, Chelle is staying put (more or less) in their hometown of Ottawa, Canada — on unceded Algonquin Anishnaabeg territory — where they wield their trusty red pen as a full-time freelance editor, review speculative fiction and erotica for _Publishers Weekly_, and act as a human shield for their chronically-anxious rescue dog. Some of their regular editing clients include Europe Comics (for whom they edit graphic novels translated from French into English), Fireside Fiction (for whom they copyedit and proofread every issue of _Fireside Magazine_), and _Publishers Weekly_'s BookLife Reviews (for whom they edit reviews). They also devote a significant portion of their time to their role as the Program Co-Chair for Readercon, a world-renowned conference on imaginative literature; there, Chelle helps develop the program and select panelists, helps build and edit all participant bios, and also edits the annual Program Guide and Souvenir Book.

If you’re ever in Ottawa and notice someone’s taken a handful of colourful Sharpies to ugly comments on the inside of all the public bathroom stalls, there’s a good chance that someone was them.
