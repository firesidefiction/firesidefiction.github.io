Chelle Parker is a queer, non-binary, neuroatypical, disabled mega-nerd and has enjoyed an unusually colourful life, having lived in or visited fourteen countries on four continents and learned seven languages along the way. Chelle's background is primarily in education, where she spent eight years teaching English, French, math, science, and life skills to at-risk junior-high students, but she's also worked in a peculiar array of other environments. These range from daycares to sexual health clinics, doing jobs as diverse as librarian, baker, radio DJ, and Braille transcriptionist, all while editing on the side.

These days, Chelle is staying put (more or less) in her hometown of Ottawa, Canada, where she wields her trusty red pen as a freelance [editor-for-hire](https://www.mparkerediting.com) and acts as a human shield for her chronically-anxious rescue dog. Some of her regular gigs include copyediting everything for _Fireside Magazine/Fireside Quarterly_, translating and editing graphic novels for Europe Comics, and reviewing speculative fiction and erotica for _Publishers Weekly_. She is also a member of multiple professional organizations, including Editors Canada, the Editorial Freelancers Association, the American Copy Editors Society, and the Association of Independent Publishing Professionals.

If you're ever in Ottawa and notice someone's taken a handful of colourful Sharpies to ugly comments on the inside of all the public bathroom stalls, there's a good chance that someone was her.
