[Courtney Floyd](https://synonymsandsuch.com) is a Ph.D. Candidate and writing instructor at the University of Oregon. She created, produces, and co-hosts Victorian Scribblers, a podcast about all the Victorian writers you've probably never heard of but should have. Her favorite Modernist poem is H.D.'s "Eurydice," and like the Sybil she lives for a good espresso.
