Once a Silicon Valley software engineer, Curtis C. Chen (陳致宇) now writes stories and runs puzzle games near Portland, Oregon. He's the author of the Kangaroo series of funny science-fiction spy thrillers and has written for the Realm originals _Ninth Step Murders_, _Machina_, and _Echo Park 2060_ (forthcoming). Curtis's short stories have appeared in _Playboy Magazine_, _Daily Science Fiction_, _Oregon Reads Aloud_, and elsewhere. His homebrew cat-feeding robot was displayed in the "Worlds Beyond Here" exhibit at Seattle's Wing Luke Museum. Visit him online at CurtisCChen.com.
