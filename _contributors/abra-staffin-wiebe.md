Abra Staffin-Wiebe loves optimistic science fiction, cheerful horror, and dark fantasy. Dozens of her short stories have appeared at publications including _Tor.com_, _The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction_, _Escape Pod_, and _Odyssey Magazine_. You may have heard her voice as a narrator for the Escape Artists family of podcasts. She also edits Aswiebe's Market List, a resource for writers.  She lives in Minneapolis, where she wrangles her children, pets, and the mad scientist she keeps in the attic. When not writing or wrangling, she collects folk tales and photographs whatever stands still long enough to allow it. Her novella, _The Unkindness of Ravens_ (Bimulous Books, 2018), is an epic fantasy about trickster gods and favors owed. Discover more of her fiction at her website, aswiebe.com.
