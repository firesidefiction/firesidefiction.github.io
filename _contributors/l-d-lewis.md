L.D. Lewis does... a lot. She is an award-winning SF/F writer and editor. She serves as a founding creator, art director, and project manager for the World Fantasy Award-winning and Hugo Award-nominated FIYAH Literary Magazine. She also serves as the founding director of Hugo-nominated FIYAHCON, chair of the 2021 Nebula Conference, awards manager for the Lambda Literary Foundation, treasurer for Diverse Voice Inc., and grants administrator for the Speculative Literature Foundation. She acquires novellas for Tor.com and researches for the LeVar Burton Reads podcast. She frequently bothers the publishing industry by authoring studies about the treatment and experiences of racially/ethnically marginalized authors in speculative literature. She is the author of _A Ruin of Shadows_ (Dancing Star Press, 2018), and her published short fiction and poetry includes appearances in _FIYAH_, _PodCastle_, _Strange Horizons_, _Anathema: Spec from the Margins_, _Lightspeed Magazine_, and _Fireside Magazine_, among others. She lives in Georgia, on perpetual deadline, with her coffee habit, two demon cats, and an impressive Funko Pop! collection.
