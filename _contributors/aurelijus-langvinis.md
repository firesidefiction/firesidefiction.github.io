Aurelijus Langvinis is a concept artist and interior designer from Lithuania. Though he also paints digitally, he prefers to work in traditional media—primarily oil on canvas—when creating fantastical works as he appreciates how increasingly rare it's becoming. His goal is to someday create games and write books based on the worlds in his paintings. For more of his art, visit his website at langvinis.com or @a.langvinis on Instagram.
