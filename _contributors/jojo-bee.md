As a child Jojo was a wild thing who spent her time climbing trees, playing with animals, and dreaming up adventure. She now spends her time playing roller derby, cuddling her three pets... and dreaming up adventure. She believes representation matters and strives to portray vivid and complex characters, as colorful as her imagination.
