R J Theodore (she/her) is an author, graphic designer, podcaster, and all-around collector of creative endeavors and hobbies. She enjoys writing about magic-infused technologies, first contact events, and bioluminescing landscapes.
Her love of SF/F storytelling developed through grabbing for all things unicorn-themed as a child, but she was subverted by tales of distant solar systems when her brother introduced her to _Star Trek: The Next Generation_. A few years later, _Sailor Moon_ taught her stories can have both.
When she's not tinkering in her own worlds, she reads for both pleasure and research, sews, plays video games, cooks, and — when she can let herself be still — naps with her pets.
She lives in New England, haunted by her childhood cat.
