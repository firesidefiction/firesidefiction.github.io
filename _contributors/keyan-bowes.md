Keyan Bowes is a peripatetic writer of science fiction and fantasy based in San Francisco. She's lived in nine cities in seven countries, and visited many more (and still hopes to add even more to the list). These places sometimes form the settings for her stories. Her work can be found online in various webzines (including a Polish one), a podcast, and an award-winning short film; and on paper in a dozen print anthologies. She’s a graduate of the 2007 Clarion Workshop for science fiction and fantasy writers. Keyan’s website is at [www.keyanbowes.org](http://www.keyanbowes.org).
