Called “violent, poetic and compulsively readable” by Maclean’s, science fiction author Tobias S. Buckell is a _New York Times_ Bestselling writer born in the Caribbean. He grew up in Grenada and spent time in the British and US Virgin Islands, and the islands he lived on influence much of his work.

His Xenowealth series begins with _Crystal Rain_. Along with other stand-alone novels and his over seventy stories, his works have been translated into nineteen different languages. He has been nominated for awards like the Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, and the Astounding Award for Best New Science Fiction Author. His latest novel is _The Tangled Lands_ written with Paolo Bacigalupi, which the _Washington Post_ said is “a rich and haunting novel that explores a world where magic is forbidden.”

He currently lives in Bluffton, Ohio with his wife, twin daughters, and a pair of dogs. He can be found online at www.TobiasBuckell.com and is also an instructor at the Stonecoast MFA in Creative Writing program.
