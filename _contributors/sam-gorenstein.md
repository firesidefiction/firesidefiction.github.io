Sam Gorenstein is from Guilderland, N.Y. He has previously served as writing chair for the UAlbany Sketch and Situational Comedy Club. He runs a webcomic at [thesearethethings.smackjeeves.com](http://thesearethethings.smackjeeves.com), and is available on twitter at [@SamIsNotADoctor](https://twitter.com/SamIsNotADoctor). They say on nights when there's not too much fog, if you look closely, you can still see his ghost ship sailing just off the bay.
