**Mariana Palova** is an enthusiastic alchemist who, from time to time, likes to do a bit of magic. Born in Jalisco, Mexico in 1990, she decided to dedicate her life to a constant and disastrous search for her own personality, which has led her to become a writer, artist, and forest creature. With a special weakness for nature, wolves, occultism, and folk music, her visual work has been exhibited in more than seventy shows around the world. Her first literary saga, Nation of the Beasts, was recently acquired to be published in the United States and Latin America. Nowadays, her biggest dream is to get a small wood cabin in Alaska and live forever happy, surrounded by her books.
