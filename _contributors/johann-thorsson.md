Johann Thorsson lives on an island in the middle of the north-Atlantic ocean, with his girlfriend and two children. He worries that his allergy to cats means that he can never make it as a writer. He writes about books for Bookriot, blogs at [jthorsson.com](http://jthorsson.com), and can be found lurking on Twitter as [@johannthors](http://twitter.com/@johannthors).
