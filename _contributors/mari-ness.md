Mari Ness is not quite as obsessed with myth and fairy tales as her fiction might suggest.  Her fiction and poetry have appeared in multiple places, including Tor.com, Clarkesworld, Lightspeed, Daily Science Fiction, Apex, Uncanny, Strange Horizons, and Nightmare, and she blogs weekly at Tor.com on various geeky subjects, most recently about Disney animated movies and their literary sources.
