Elly Bangs was raised in a new-age cult, had six wisdom teeth, and once rode her bicycle alone from Seattle to the Panama Canal. Now she lives by the Salish Sea, where she spends her days fixing machines and her nights writing bizarre love stories and hopeful dystopias. Her short fiction has appeared in _Clarkesworld Magazine_, _Beneath Ceaseless Skies_, and _Strange Horizons_, and her debut postapocalyptic cyberpunk novel is on its way from Tachyon Publications.
