Sam spent her first year after college working as a chemical engineer in southern India. She completed a doctorate on the mathematics of river meandering and now works as an applied mathematician at a radar research laboratory. She loves to run, to write, to read. She and her adorable, nerdy husband had one of those early-pandemic micro-weddings. They live just outside Boston in a house that is painfully and obviously the most deteriorated one on its street. (They’re working on that.) One of their cats wishes to explore every corner of the universe and greet everyone while doing so. The other prefers to purr on keyboards or on shoulders and has perfected a useful skill during the pandemic: snatching and darting off with entire treat bags between his sharp teeth. Sam is a grateful graduate of the Odyssey Writing Workshop, without which she has no doubt she would never have been published here. Her work has appeared in _After the Orange: Ruin and Recovery_ (B. Cubed Press, 2018) and in _Prismatica Magazine_ (Issue 11).
