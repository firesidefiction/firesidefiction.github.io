Sofie Bird writes speculative fiction in Melbourne, Australia, and pays the bills as a technical writer, where no one looks at her askance for wanting to know everything. She also programs, weaves, sculpts glass, and maintains a website at [sofiebird.net](http://sofiebird.net). Sofie is a graduate of the Odyssey Writing Workshop, has published poetry in the Australian periodical Blue Dog, and her fiction has appeared in Orson Scott Card’s Intergalactic Medicine Show, and the anthology *Temporally Out Of Order*, by Zombies Need Brains. You can follow her on Twitter [@sofie\_bird](https://twitter.com/@sofie_bird).
