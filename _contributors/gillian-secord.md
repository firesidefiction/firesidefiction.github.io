Gillian Secord is a speculative fiction writer from Toronto, Canada, whose work has previously appeared in _Cossmass Infinities_ and _Polar Borealis_, among others. When she's not writing, she's scouring the city for good coffee shops and collecting vinyl. Recently she's taken up juggling, bringing her one step closer to her childhood dream of running away and joining the circus.

You can find her online at gilliansecord.wordpress.com and on Twitter at @GillianSecord.
