      <h2>Support Ongoing Costs</h2>
      <h3>A pay-what-you-want monthly donation</h3><br>
      <p>Although we're winding down, we will continue to publish the stories from <em>Fireside Magazine</em>'s final issue each week here on our site as usual, and we intend to keep the website running as an archive so that all the amazing stories, poems, and essays we've published will remain available to read.
The ongoing costs of doing so will not longer be offset by magazine subscriptions, so instead we have a new pay-what-you-want recurring donation "subscription". Fireside is not a registered charity, so this donation would not be tax-deductible, but it would be a tremendous help.</p>
