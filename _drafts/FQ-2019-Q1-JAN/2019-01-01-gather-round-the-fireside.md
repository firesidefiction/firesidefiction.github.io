Dear Reader,

Welcome to our first quarterly issue of 2019! We’re taking this first quarter to stretch and explore language and identity and boundaries and relationships. This issue contains our first foray into bilingual stories with “Parasitismo”/“Parasitism” by Alberto Chimal. We’re all really excited to have a story in Spanish with an English translation in our magazine. Both Pablo and I are Latinx, so this is particularly exciting to us personally. 

We’ve also got some great thoughts on language and identity from returning Fireside author, Layla Al-Bedawi. Layla’s background in language from an academic perspective gives a unique backdrop for the very personal essay exploring how her relationship with different languages changes her. Meanwhile, Russell Nichols and George Lockett give us two very different fictional takes on how our engagement with language can change our lives for better, or for much worse…. 

As ever, we’re all about rising up and speaking truth, and in 2019 we’ve expanded our capacity to do that by adding poetry to our lineup. We’ve got three amazing poems from Sabrina Vourvoulias, Sheree Renée Thomas, and Fran Wilde, all of which are about surviving and showing strength to oppression. 

We’re also looking at different experiences that women have, with fiction from Brandon O’Brien, Jennifer Stephan Kapral, Stu West, Mary Soon Lee, Eden Royce, and Karen Osborne, and an essay by Kenesha Williams. All of these pieces challenge and explore different kinds of societally imposed narratives of female experience. Three of these (the O’Brien, Lee, and Osborne stories) are illustrated, too!

Finally, as a whole, we love teamwork and community building, and several of our pieces reflect that in different ways. We have Sarah Gailey’s essay (which Elsa edited!) about the importance of cultivating self-awareness about power dynamics, and stories like “Teamwork” by A.T. Greenblatt, “A Symphony for the Space Between the Stars” by Jenn Reese, and “By the Storytelling Fire” by Jaymee Goh, all of which bring individuals together to break away from traditional ideas of harmful orderliness and form healthier community dynamics of their own. 

As we dig into 2019, we’re looking for hope, for resilience and resistance, for strength, and as always, for love. I hope you’ll find all of those within!

All Best,
Julia Rios, Fiction Editor
