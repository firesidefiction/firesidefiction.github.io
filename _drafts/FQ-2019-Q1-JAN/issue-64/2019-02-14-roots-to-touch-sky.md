&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The story of trees  
is pressed into their flesh  
and in their gnarled roots  
breath

The amount of foliage overhead  
can be corrected   
with the amount of root tissue  
below

and in the ground, the mouth of earth  
under the canopy of dark and light  
under the canopy of roots   
and fallen leaves  
lives a city of bones

and the names   
that gave the bones flesh  
and the flesh that gave   
the names life

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. In the future  
fossils give the hardened record  
of half-lives, the imprint  
of those worked beyond exhaustion  
of shoulders grooved with   
the weight of despair

of minds lost in a cave of  
dreams, a record of nameless  
labor, of plunder

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Coal is made from the carbon  
of ancient trees  
that did not decay to powder  
that did not give way   
to the tyranny of oxygen

to understand this subversive resistance  
is to imprint the world  
with images that give rise   
to its beginning and its end  
to understand is  
to name the nameless

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. I am here to wonder  
to give up roots   
to grow beyond expectation  
to become both air and light  
to retract, to retreat into density  
to unfurl these twisting sinews   
of thought

we are here to move  
to be moved, we the half-lives, the past  
an upturned tree with shallow roots  
we emerge from the dark  
reaching for light  
our lives held up in the sun  
like a great unlined hand
