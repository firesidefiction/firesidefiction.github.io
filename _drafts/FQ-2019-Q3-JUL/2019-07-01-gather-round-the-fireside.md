Dear Reader,

In the US, where Team Fireside is based, July is right in the middle of summertime. It's the perfect time to sit around a campfire and tell some spooky stories. We wanted to give you a few things to give you some ominous shivers even as you enjoy that warm summer sunshine. Hopefully "The Brightest Lights of Heaven" by Maria Haskins, and "Amanda Draws Crows" by José Iriarte will fit the bill. These stories are very different, but both of them have me holding my breath as I read them. Mind the content notes on both of these, though! We're countering that tension and darkness with the July poem by Ali Trotta, which is full of hope and warmth.

One strong theme this issue is cages. Some of them are very literal, while others are more abstract, though no less confining. Our shortest piece is "Petals" by Joanne Rixon, which is literally about breaking out of prison, and uses ideas suggested by some teens she works with at a detention center. How awesome is that? "Signal" by L. D. Lewis has a different take on kids breaking out of their societal cage, while "Fare" by Danny Lore gives us a completely different look at someone voluntarily going _into_ a cage. Of course, it should be clear enough that "Not All Caged Birds Sing" by Sheree Renée Thomas fits right in with this theme, too! Our August poem is by Charles Payseur, and takes on the ways that scrambling to make ends meet in an oppressive economic climate can be a cage. Grace Villmow's essay takes on some of those same issues as she examines the environmentalist movement and how it can both help and hurt society's most vulnerable members. Finally, we have a super disturbing story that re-examines the concepts of both breaking free and being confined. Make sure you understand the content notes for "For What Dignity Remains" by Michelle Muenzler before you start that one, but it certainly gave me plenty to think about.

"Shelter, Sustenance, Self" by Aimee Ogden and "Advice for Your First Time at the Faerie Market" by Nibedita Sen are two very different ultimately sweet, if a bit heartbreaking, looks at parenting and identity. But of course children have their own identity struggles, and we recognize those, too. "Questions to Grow Up On" by Ashley Deng, and "Boxes" by Jacqui Talbot examine more questions of identity and family, and what happens when you think you fit in one category, and then the rest of the world decides you're in another.

And at last we come to possibly my very favorite thing about this quarterly volume of _Fireside_. In 2018 I had the enormous honor and pleasure of attending Worldcon 76 as part of The Mexicanx Initiative. I got to meet so many amazingly talented Mexicanx writers and artists there, and that made me really want to celebrate Mexican Independence Day, which is not Cinco de Mayo, as many US residents seem to believe. It happens in September, starting late at night on the 15th and then all day on the 16th. This year, I wanted to do something extra special to celebrate it, so I invited three Mexicanx authors to contribute stories in Spanish. Raquel Castro and Iliana Vargas give us two different tales involving supernatural creatures, while Libia Brenda imagines the founding of the city of Puebla (where she is from) as a literal city of angels. David Bowles (who, like me, lives in the US and has Mexicanx heritage) gave us an essay about Mexicanx folklore, which is amazing because David really knows his Mexicanx history, and also because it's chillingly personal. To top it all off, we got Mexicanx artist Mariana Palova to illustrate David's essay. Happy Mexican Independence Month, everyone!

All Best,

Julia Rios, Editor
