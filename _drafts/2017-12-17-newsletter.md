Hi everybody!
This week we have a wonderful story from Brian M. Milton. _[Rab the Giant versus the Witch of the Waterfall](https://firesidefiction.com/rab-the-giant-versus-the-witch-of-the-waterfall)_ is a charming, low key, feel-good tale about patience, empathy and compassion winning the day over frazzled combativeness. Brian acquired it, Julia edited it, and it’s a fantastic read to close out the year. The accompanying illustration by Marianne Khalil is just _pitch-perfect_, and she was a pleasure to work with.
The Patreon Fiasco has come to an end! Patreon has decided it made a mistake and has canceled plans to change its fee structure. This is absolutely good news, full stop. It keeps Patreon around as a viable option for the majority of our supporters.
And yet. We’re still out a bunch of our monthly revenue. Fortunately we have savings, and we’ve had some really, really generous Anonymous Heroes step in, so we’re okay in the short term. But we need to find a way to make up the hundreds of dollars we lost in monthly income, literally overnight 😬 (technically it was a _few_ nights — I know because I didn’t sleep much.)
It’s clear that having just one revenue stream is asking for trouble. We’ve known this for a while and have been making plans to address that. Part of those plans was to set up a direct subscription service through our website, and the Patreon debacle prompted me to accelerate those plans. You can now [subscribe to the monthly ebook delivery directly via our site](https://firesidefiction.com/#support-fireside), at various price points designed to fit your ability to pay. (Don’t scoff at the $100 level — we’ve already had at least one signup there!) You can also sign up for yearly subscriptions, and even send those out as gifts! Just in time for the holidays. 🎁
A lot of people have asked us whether we prefer people support us on Patreon or directly on our site.
First and foremost, everyone should do what works best for them. We’re grateful for every cent of support, no matter where it comes from, and we want it to be as easy as it can be for you to support us. So you do you, and we thank you for it. That’s the deal. 
But if you want a straight “we like this better” answer, well, it’s complicated. 
If we go by straight fees, Patreon is probably better, in terms of keeping more money in the short term. But it’s obvious that we don’t own the relationship with our supporters on Patreon. I didn’t like having to apologize to our backers on behalf of decisions we didn’t make or support, and I really didn’t like that we exposed you all to what still amounts to a bait-and-switch.
The system behind the subscription service on our site, Memberful, does fewer things than Patreon, but it gives us much more control over how we treat you all. Plus, since we’re “closer to the metal,” we can do things like offer codes, discounts, and refunds, which will help us promote the things we have planned in the new year to make Fireside even better.
So if it’s all the same to you, we prefer people subscribe directly on our site. Going forward, we’re going to focus on providing additional value to our direct subscribers and to supporters on future platforms — especially to supporters who subscribe at $10 a month and higher. Yes, that is a hint.
The direct subscription is just one of the things we’ve been working on.  We’ve also been working on building a store where you can buy Fireside-branded merchandise, ebooks of our back issues, novellas and novels, and — finally, after many months of requests — Antifascist Fiction Club enamel pins. The Fireside store lives at [shop.firesidefiction.com](https://shop.firesidefiction.com), and it’s open for business right now. We’re letting you know about it before we make a wider announcement later this week. We’re also giving you a discount for subscribing to our newsletter (and for reading this far): if you buy something over the next week, use the code “kickoff” to get 20% off your order.
We’ve got more cool things coming your way in the new year. 
As always, thanks for reading.
