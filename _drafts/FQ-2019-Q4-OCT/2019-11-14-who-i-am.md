i told you i was a river
and you bathed in me,
leaving me cleaner.
with rocks from my bed
you lined your walls,
and now i am home.

i rush and tumble and
speak in tongues,
but you lean your ear and
smile at the right parts.

someday, i may wear you down,
erode the years until
i've pushed you out to the sea.
until then, i feed the grasses
all along my banks and
encourage them to bloom.
someday, i may feed flowers.

i told you i was a river
and you took the news solemnly.
if you put your candles on me,
i will float them safely out.
