Dear Reader,

Welcome to the final quarter of 2019, and my final quarter as editor of _Fireside Magazine_. It's truly been an honor and a pleasure to work with so many wonderful authors on amazing stories, essays, and poems during my time at Fireside. It is also an enormous honor and pleasure to share them with you.

Where I live, the trees turn riotous shades of red and orange and yellow in October. This last burst of color preludes dropping all of their leaves. We begin the process of gearing up for winter. The wind and the rain reminds us that colder and darker times are on the way. Perhaps it is because of this that many of us have come to associate this month with ghosts, loss, death, and hauntings. This October, we've got five stories that explore these themes in different ways.

"Lost Girl" by Catherine Lundoff sets a gothic tone with a ghostly narrator in an ominous house, while "The haunting of 13 Olúwo Street" by Suyi Davies Okungbowa flips that theme on its head with a narrator who _is_ a haunted house in Lagos, Nigeria. Mind the content warning on that last one: it contains some difficult scenes, but I hope you, like me, will find it worth reading. "On the Other Side of the Line" by A. T. Greenblatt examines the senseless feeling of loss in a world where a bright line divides loved ones. This one isn't really about a house or a ghost, and yet it seems in dialogue with both. Finally, "Radio Static" by Caroline Jansen gives us a ghostly narrator who wants to let her love move on, and "What Cannot Follow" by Eugenia Triantafyllou explores what it means to make space for people who have died but haven't left. As we move into the dark time of year in the Northern Hemisphere, I hope you (like me) will find thoughtful solace in these stories.

November and December's stories focus more on the way we treat the living than how we grieve the dead. "Personal Rakshasi" by Suzan Palumbo and "Partially True (But Mostly Not)" by Sherin Nicole take two different looks at how external and internal pressures and criticism can significantly affect personality and health. "FEMALE COMPUTER WANTED, APPLY WITHIN" by Innocent Ilo and "The Boy on the Roof" by Francesca Forrest explore ways in which societies can use external factors (like technology and climate change) to devalue certain people, while "Baterías" ("Batteries") by Patricia Coral and "There Is No Beauty Without Resistance" by Dominica Phetteplace take on the diffucult task of bringing people hope in times of great hardship. And last, "I Send My Tower Walking" by Amanda Helms, "Where You Are Now Is Better Than Where You Were Before" by Eliza Victoria, and "Under the Peach Tree" by Kerry Truong give us characters who must learn to adapt and find strength and community in the face of harrowing changes. All of these stories are complex. Not all of them end happily, but they collectively offer validation for the marginalized, food for thought, and –  for me, at least – hope.

The essays and poetry in this issue continue this same work. Diana Lu's "White Saviorism and the Brooklyn Hammer Murders" and Brandon O'Brien's "Getting Out of the Cold: Revisiting Toxic Masculinity in _Lethal Weapon_" both look at ways that society devalues some people and urges people to conform to often unhealthy stereotypes, while Elsa Sjunneson-Henry's "The Emotional Beats of Becoming a Guide Dog Handler" takes on that sense of finding strength and community through the process of learning how to work in a closely-bonded team – an impressive feat. On the poetry side, "After Living With Him" by Okwudili Nebeolisa and "who i am" by Amber Bird both explore self-acceptance and owning one's identity, the first in a difficult time, after a loss, and the second in the context of welcoming a healthy relationship. Meanwhile "Mrs. Q" by C. S. E. Cooney is all about seeing a person fully and celebrating their fierce uniqueness.

I hope you'll leave this issue full of emotions and thoughts and sustenance enough to keep you strong through the winter and ready to face the coming year. Thank you so much for joining me here by the fireside one last time.

All Best,
Julia Rios, Editor
