In September we had our first reading period in which I was acting as the Fiction Editor instead of Brian J. White. We were open to flash and short story submissions of up to 4,000 words. We received 1,022 submissions and accepted 26, an acceptance rate of about 2.5 percent. This is likely a lot higher than our acceptance rate will be in future reading periods, but for various reasons, I went a little wild this time.

For the third time, we asked submitters to take a quick, anonymous, 100% voluntary survey in which we asked people’s race and ethnicity. Here are the results of the [first](https://firesidefiction.com/march2017-submissions-results) and [second](https://firesidefiction.com/april2017-submissions-results) surveys for reference.

Of the 1,022 submitters, 841 responded to the survey, or about 82 percent, a lower response rate than the 86% we’ve seen before, but it’s still enough to see some overall trends in who is submitting to Fireside.

Here are the results of the survey:

- **Black:** 43 (5.1%—down from 8.0% in our April period and 7.6% in our March period)
- **Hispanic/Latinx:** 46 (5.5%—up from 4.4% in April, but still lower than the 6.1% in March)
- **Asian/Pacific Islander:** 53 (6.3%—down from 7.3% in April and 6.8% in March)
- **First Peoples/Native American/Native Canadian:** 14 (1.7%—down from 2.6% in April and slightly down from 2.9% in March)
- **White:** 682 (81.1%—up from 77.4% in April and 79.7% in March)

We also had a few fill in responses from people who identified as mixed, Jewish, Indian, and minority language speakers within their geographical area. As usual, a few people also gave responses that weren’t relevant to the survey.

And now! Here are the stories we bought from September:
