You sip your coffee down to the dregs, then cast the spell for another, noting you have some time before work this morning. No doctors’ waiting rooms today. No prescription pickups. And the child is already at school, and didn’t forget her wand this time, so this is the perfect moment for dealing with the paperwork that sometimes comes with your latest medical adventure—let’s just call that one "No, it wasn’t anxiety after all."

The kitchen is quiet, only the rustle of semi-sentient unopened bills and the sharp cry of your mother—the Oracle’s—seagull-borne message about whether you want to try yoga (you don’t), distracts you from your task. You ignore the noise and focus on getting the paperwork together for your disabled wizard’s placard.

Really, you might just put it off until after you finish marking essays on the intersection of wizarding physics and mechanical engineering. But your trip is looming and you need the placard to get disabled services on the next quest. So. Do you:

A. Go to the University to grade those essays, and plan to deal with this later (again).

B. Tackle the form so you have what you need.

----

[A]

You take a long sip of coffee and swallow. You really should fill out that form.

You have to literally tackle the paperwork, since it’s grown much faster and more opinionated since you first brought it home. You miss, and it speeds out the window. Hopefully there’s a copy online too.

----

[B]

Great! There’s an online version of the form to replace the paperwork. You just need to remember your password. This should be easy.

It would be except your last password had to contain seven characters, a wingding, and the recipe for spotted newt, and you can’t remember whether you used your grandmother’s recipe or your great-grandfather’s.

You request a new password. The website cackles at you and calls you names, but lets you do it. Finally, you download the form. It needs to be signed by a doctor.

No, not the doctor you’re seeing tomorrow, the other one, farther away.

----

Doctors don’t take emails, or talk through mirrors, or accept chiropteran-deliveries, They all use an antiquated technology called a facsimile machine (fax), which requires that you also have a fax, or know someone who does, or an app that mimics a fax on your phone (unlike an mirror or email which does exactly the same thing, you think, grumpily). You sip your coffee.

Your nerves are feeling a bit jangled.

You need a printer to make a paper copy of the thing you’ll need to fax. Or you’ll need to pay for the app’s secure fax service. (Which doesn’t do anything much different than an email and actually you highly suspect it is email software glamoured with a cheap fax spell.)

Do you:

A. Print and fax the document?

B. Download the app?

----

[A]

You don’t have a printer. Or a fax. You aren’t a doctors’ office. Doctors’ offices are the only users of obsolete fax technology, much like wizards are the only users of wand technology…

Don’t get started on wizard technology, Okay? Here, have some more coffee.

----

[B]

You spend the rest of your morning downloading the app, registering, making a password you’ll forget, and giving them a credit card. You’ll need to fill out the form and send it after work. The app slows your phone to a crawl. If this was a bat, you could bribe it with strawberries or a small beetle. If it was a mirror you could smash—wait no, no smashing mirrors. You really wish the app was a bat.

Your phone dings and the document finally sends. You delete the app from your phone, and wait.

----

And wait. It’s been a few days.

----

Did you actually send the document? You phone and check.

The Doctor’s office will phone you when the form is ready.

----

The Doctor’s office phones and asks for your fax number.

You didn’t pay the extra money on the app so you could receive faxes. They don’t want to use your mirror.

You give the doctor your mailing address.

You deal with other things, life stuff, family needs.

Your quest comes and goes. You do not get a traveler assist on the travel portions this time (eagles are the WORST), and you end up going missing until several members of your party come to find you, which is not only embarrassing, but could jeopardize your career.

Still, you have another quest coming up soon and your document will be useful then.

----

The doctor’s office envelope arrives in the mail. You open it and realize you need to get the form notarized before you can send it back to the place that will get you your documents.

Do you:

A. Give up

B. Find a notary? (A notary, much like a fax, is ancient tech in the form of a person who proves you are who you say you are by looking you in the eyes, and at your identification aura, and then affixing a seal to a document that says they did just that. Then you pay them. So far, this free document will cost you 21 gold coins. That’s enough to fix the child’s wand, which was temporarily lost on the bus and got stepped on.)

----

[A]

No! Don’t give up! You need this thing. Much like the medicine your insurance denied, and the therapy your insurance also denied, your doctor has emphasized how important it is for you to have this document. Don’t give up now!

----

Fine.

----

[B]

You look online for a notary. Some seem to think you can find these people called notaries at banks and other institutions. But due to cost cutting, there are only smoking dark spots on the industry-standard green carpets where the notaries last stood, so you must find someone else, somewhere else. You see there are three notaries within driving distance of you. You adjust your work schedule to include stopping at the notary, because you have chosen not to give up.

The notary is closed when you arrive.

Another notary is no longer working where the Notary-and-Car-Service-finding spell said they were.

You begin to believe that notaries are like some wizards. Useful, but difficult to catch.

You continue your search.

You hear through the rumor mill at the witches and wizards university where you teach that a notary was recently spotted at a local package and shipping store. You shift your schedule to the time that they were last seen there.

The shipping store looks like a cave of cardboard boxes.

Do you:

A. Go in. What could possibly go wrong?

B. Go home and download a notary app where you upload all your personal information to a safe and secure site in some unnamed country and wait for a stamped printed copy of your form to arrive, sometime.

----

[A]

Wise choice! (Those apps have really bad reviews. Unlike emailed signed document technology that most of the rest of the world uses now, but hey, this is a disability adventure, so you must work with only the most deprecated of technology because… Well you just have to. Maybe it’s for plot reasons. Maybe it’s because no one has taken a look at how usable the system is since the 1980s.)

You go in. The cardboard boxes close in around you. They form a dark passageway. You see two small lights at the end of the passageway.

Is that the notary? You wish you’d brought a flashlight. The two small lights at the end of the passageway grow bigger. Is this someone with a stamp who will prove you exist so you can send in the form? The lights brighten until you are dazzled and you feel cold fingers touch your sleeve.

"Are you a notary?" The person with the cold fingers asks."I need a notary."
"I am looking for a notary too," you whisper. You are disappointed but it will be nice to have someone to travel with through the maze of cardboard boxes. Except.

Except that this not-notary came the other way."How long have you been in here?" You ask. You lean on your cane because this is longer than you are used to standing, and it may be longer still.

"A long time," the not-notary says."I was once a wizard, but I needed a form for a new wand."

They do not look like a wizard. They have, you can see now, very sharp teeth. You can see this even though it is very dark because their eyes are glowing.

Do you:

A. Run

B. Continue to talk to them.

----

[A]

Hah. You can’t run, silly. Duh.

----

[B]

"Are you real?" You ask, perhaps unwisely, but you’re in need of coffee and obviously not running anywhere fast and it’s nice to hear another voice, even a strange one.

"Are you?" The not-notary asks.

"I need a notary to say so," you say, walking slowly down the twisting corridor. You feel the cold fingers of the not-notary touch your neck. You want to shriek, but you wait until their jaw is close enough to bite…

And you hold the form up, so that their teeth pierce the paper just enough, at just the right spot, that it looks like a notary did it.

Then you turn on your phone’s flashlight and the not-notary shrinks away, screeching.

And you use the last of your energy-reserve spells to get the heck out of there as fast as you can.

You exist. You have the marks to prove it.

And you have your form. And that didn’t take so long after all.
Good work!
