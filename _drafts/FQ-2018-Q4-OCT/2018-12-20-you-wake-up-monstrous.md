_You wake up...
 You have no mouth. You try to scream for help as a bug crawls across your skin.

You wake up...
Your hands are pincers. You can’t get out of bed, get dressed, or do a single thing you used to do.

You wake up...
to your family around you, watching you disintegrate,	their eyes wide with fear and disgust._

Disability as a fear mechanism is a tool that body horror entertainment has played with for so very long. Scenes from familiar books and movies can invoke an intense feeling of shock, revulsion, alarm, or panic no matter how many times they’re watched, often by removing a character’s abilities, agency, or senses onscreen, or by showing them waking up without those abilities — while viewers observe from a safe distance.

Body horror is entertainment toying with an edge of reality — engaging a there-but-for-the-grace-of fear of being trapped in a body-cage, losing physical agency, or witnessing that happening to someone else. When this is an entertainment, the act of witnessing is part of the experience. And often that experience seems edifying, in that observers feel they’ve learned something from the moment or discovered an increasing sense of empathy for someone else, as reported by viewers soon after _The Elephant Man_ was released.

But when that experience shifts to second person — trading a Neo, Gregor, or Seth for a ‘you’ — the horror can be doubled. You are more than witness to the event. You are the part of the show.

The experience becomes uncomfortable, and not necessarily as entertaining.

*You wake up and can’t get out of bed, your hands are claws, your skin is covered in welts, your jaw is                      	dislocated
            	and you, at least temporarily, cannot speak.*

It all depends on point of view. For instance, when I watch body horror or its cousins body humor and inspiration porn — yes, I’ll argue that they’re related — I often feel trapped on the inside. This is in part because I’ve been there — I’ve woken up and had to put my joints back together before I could move — and in part because I’m being expected to interpret realities that I and others deal with on a regular day as constructs to be afraid of, or laughed at, or inspired by.

Witness with me one of these scenes taking place in a great-grandparent of body horror — Franz Kafka’s _The Metamorphosis_.

“At first he wanted to get off the bed with the lower part of his body, but this lower part … proved itself too difficult to move. The attempt went so slowly. When, having become almost frantic, he finally hurled himself forward with all his force and without thinking, he chose his direction incorrectly, and he hit the lower bedpost hard. ... as he finally raised his head outside the bed in the open air, he became anxious about moving forward any further in this manner, for if he allowed himself eventually to fall by this process, it would take a miracle to prevent his head from getting injured. And at all costs he must not lose consciousness right now. He preferred to remain in bed.”

Already, by this moment, Kafka’s main character Victor Samsa knows from waking in the first paragraph that he’s been changed into a bug. The _audience_ knows that he’s a bug. What’s left is to watch him flail around and logic himself into this somehow being a new normal.

And yet, for many outside of the book, this method of getting out of bed (or not) is normal — not new, and not an entertainment. It is a daily event, seen from the inside out.

Similarly, visible illness and deformity (whether you wake up as a bug or not) focus of many of the intense feelings found in body horror — from the distortions of Stephen King’s Captain Trips in _The Stand_ and “Night Surf” — both mental and physical — to David Cronenberg’s _The Fly_, during Seth Brundle’s cellular transformation:

“My teeth have begun to fall out. The medicine cabinet is now the Brundle Museum of Natural History. You wanna see what else is in it?”

In scenes from _The Fly_, _The Stand_, and elsewhere, family members watch in horror as those they love are transformed.

Meantime, David Lynch uses body horror to inject a high level of weird — and bonus social commentary on how “normal” is an inadequate term — into his characters. Looking at his work as a whole reveals an abled director using highly visible disabilities — missing arms, eyes, legs, blindness, and Proteus Syndrome (as in _The Elephant Man_). Lynch has been alternately praised and criticized for the ways he depicts disability in order to change perspectives. In _The Spectacle of Deformity: Freak Shows and Modern British Culture_, it is called “mawkish and moralising,” the work of a freak show display rather than a production that might allow the disabled to speak for themselves. Other media go the opposite way, deploying horror-level depictions of deformity as indications of evil characters in non-horror stories and movies, such as Baron Harkonnen in _Dune_ and Doctor Poison in _Wonder Woman_.

In all of these scenes, whether for the purpose of exploitation or promoting understanding, the horror is that of losing senses, autonomy, agency, form, and recognizable attributes in all the ‘right’ proportions.

These portrayals of disability are among my least favorite metaphors for fear because they are weak and impersonal. When they happen to someone else, they instill a third-person fear — one of difference, change, and loss — rather than a grinding personal fear of the everyday.

Despite this, I still watch and read horror, though it’s admittedly not my favorite genre. We all watch horror at least once, though sometimes don’t know that’s what we’re watching. A child character gets sick with slugs. A woman (or a man) gives birth in a particularly gory, chest-splitting way. Then the movie goes on, to the quest or the salvage. The audience goes back to focus on the other experience — the adventure.

Disability as deployed in body horror media is a different experience from the everyday lived reality of disability. Often the media version is presented as a transformation or a trap, one that may end with birth or death. The initial horror is in the moment where the character first wakes up and realizes their situation, or in the moments where they slowly change into a different form while others watch. For most of the audience, the horror is the physical squick, but another part is in the reaction of the other characters. Being transformed (and deformed) is painted on the screen again and again as something that generates fear and, occasionally, disgust. This reaction from the transformed character’s friends and relatives doubles the audience’s sense of horror.

And when it comes to witnessing the transformation, that’s a more layered effect because the audience is watching these characters being seen. In this layer, there’s a difference between body horror (as discussed above), body humor (as found in movies like _Say Anything_, where Joan Cusack  tries to drink from a water fountain while wearing an extensive Milwaukee back brace), and body sensationalism/revelation (as in the work of David Lynch). … almost always the externalist view: seeing — yes — disabled bodies, but seeing them from the exterior perspective, sometimes almost as objects, often as a means to help the viewer grow in their own understanding, rather than getting to know the person in that body) Body humor sees disability as punchline, and ‘serious movies’ see disability as inspiration porn, while body horror sees disability as a transformation to be feared.

In the safety of the theater, or the reading alcove, we love to play this game of witnessing horror. How much does it take before you are inspired? How much can you watch before turn away? What do you laugh at in private?

We play with what scares us most: loss of control, of ability. We laugh at it, sometimes. We pay for it to become an entertainment. And sometimes, watching beside you is someone who lives every day with that feeling of waking up to pincer hands, or of not being able to speak or scream, or of being unable to reach the water fountain; who lives with being looked at, turned away from, or pitied. They might laugh when you laugh. (That’s their choice.)

But why are you laughing? And why do we watch? Because we know there’s an end, if not to the character’s suffering then at least to the movie or book. We can get up and walk out of the theater, shake loose all those emotions, and feel freed from the experience.

Humor, pathos, recognition, fear — body horror plays on all of these emotions to create that experience. And when it plays with disability, it does so to capture our attention, to shock us, and to raise the stakes.

Sometimes witnessing a body transformation isn’t funny or inspiring to anyone. In _The Matrix_, when Neo’s mouth disappears, or when he wakes and pulls the cables from his head in a scene oddly reminiscent of patients pulling out IVs, it’s terrifying. Showing a bug crawling into his skin while he is unable to scream for help only heightens the horror. He hasn’t woken up like this — it’s something that’s been visibly inflicted on him by outside forces. That’s a difference between _The Matrix_ and _The Metamorphosis_, but the similarity is that the audience witnesses the transformation and the reaction.

Disability has always been part of the horror toolkit. In one way or another, sickness, deformation, and death all cast a human being as ‘other’ for being different, unattractive, without all five of the senses, or without all their parts in the expected order. Horror needs an ‘other’ — it needs something to feed its own survival.

In one sense, horror entertainment is about luck, specifically of the “aren’t you lucky this isn’t you” variety. In another, it’s about waking up to the possibility that we can all become changed over time. Body horror serves up the monstrous — as us — to a waiting audience.

By rendering disability something that happens on a screen, to a secondary character, body horror perpetuates the fear of — and the isolation of — the disabled. And, all too often, that secondary character has a limited set of emotional responses: they feel terror at their own expense, but nothing else.

Assuredly, this taking away of emotion and personhood is monstrous, but it’s not the character who’s the monster — though we see that plot twist in plenty of movies too.

And even more assuredly, there are many movies where the character’s humanity is underscored — or, in the case of Lynch, discovered — despite the horror. But here again is a dividing line between the people who are watching, discovering, learning, and people who might otherwise be seen as people, if viewers didn’t see them first on a screen as something to fear or pity.

What if the perspective changed, though? What if it was you, trapped (like a bug), watched, witnessed? What if you couldn’t leave the scene, the book, the theater. How would you feel?

That’s what body horror is often asking you to imagine, and to be afraid of. But then it lets you go. Up on the screen or in a book, it’s a piece of entertainment that will make you feel glad it isn’t happening to you. You are safe in your seat.

_Until you wake up.
Your hands are claws. Your mouth doesn’t work._

And it’s not scary, it’s just another day.
