We hope you’ve enjoyed this issue of Fireside Quarterly. We’re grateful that we can bring you new stories and artwork every week on firesidefiction.com, and four times a year in print, all while paying our authors, artists, and staff as well as we can for their hard work. Your support makes it all possible so, once more and over and over again, thank you for reading.
