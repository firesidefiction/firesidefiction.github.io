Dear Reader,

Our second print quarterly issue comes to you at the dark part of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. With that in mind, we’re exploring the darkness and taking care to remember to find some glimmers of light. Our illustrated stories in this volume reflect that search for balance with a mix of darkness and light. Brian M. Milton, who brought us "Rab the Giant versus the Witch of the Waterfall," takes us back to Scotland in "Cleaning Up," while first time Fireside authors Sara Norja and Keyan Bowes whisk us away to Finland and outer space with "Birch Daughter" and "Light and Death on the Indian Battle Station." These stories are all beautifully illustrated by Clare DeZutti, Satu Kettunen, and Saleha Chowdhury.

We’re also stretching and playing a bit with form and the boundaries of story in this volume. In particular, returning Fireside authors Sarah Gailey and Fran Wilde bring two very different stories that use format as a key part of the storytelling narrative. Gailey’s "STET" questions the ethics of teaching artificial intelligence to make life and death choices, while Wilde’s "Choose Wisely" leads us on a quest to (literally) battle bureaucracy while disabled. Pablo had a big task cut out for him in designing effective presentations for these two stories in print and for the web, and he’s awesome with design so the end result looks amazing. We encourage you to check out both to spot the differences.

Disability is one of the things we care about a lot over here on Team Fireside, so we also asked Fran Wilde to write us an essay about body horror and disability. We all felt it was fitting that Elsa should edit that one, since both of these subjects speak to her personal experience. In non-fiction this time we also have another piece of our long conversation on harassment with "Reclaiming the Right to Truth" by Tariro Ndoro. Ndoro last appeared in Fireside with the sharp short fiction piece "The Whale of Tikpiti’i." Now she returns to talk about harassment in Zimbabwe. Our third non-fiction piece is an essay by Danilo Campos that looks toward a future in which sustainable energy is possible, using past fiction and modern real world solutions as examples.

The rest of our fiction for this issue takes us on many journeys through light and darkness. Like "STET," "Inner Space" by Takim Williams deals with struggles of parenthood and loss. We also have stories of sharp teeth and sharper women with "Odontogenesis" and "Pendants of Precariousness." Both of these stories visit some of the same themes as "Rain and the Designs of Your Body," "The New Heart," and "And I Never Named Her." These stories explore how our bodies reflect our identities, and how they may alter through our own will or otherwise. And finally we have some sweet stories like "A Letter to My Sister" and "Tablecloth" that give us a little warmth to help us through the cold times.

Thank you for joining us by the fireside. I hope you find as much to think about and savor in these pages as I did.

All Best,
Julia Rios, Fiction Editor
