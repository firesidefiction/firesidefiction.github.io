When fog comes infingertips pressing the windows, it takes the distance first,that mountain we always said we’d climb,the tug in the harbor with its low horn,the bridge’s spun cables,its arches.The fog removes our familiar horizons with its pale hands and keeps coming.How do you fight fog?It seeps beneath doorways, wraps your throat,slipping into mouth and ears,stealing sound until the ship’s horn becomes a sigh.It comes for the houses, the doorknobs, the lights,makes them soft, then holds them hidden.But the tug knows to keep sounding,the bridge plants its sturdy feet deep,and you find your way out of doorsknowing the unseen mountainis always there to climb.
