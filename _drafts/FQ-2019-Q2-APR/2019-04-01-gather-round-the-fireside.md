Dear Reader,

Thank you for joining us by the Fireside and sharing in our delight with stories. This quarter we've got a wonderful array for pieces that explore the concepts of home and family and how they inform our identities.

Pieces like "Balompié" by Ana Hurtado and "All the Hometowns You Can't Stay Away From" by Izzy Wasserstein (with an illustration by Matt Davis) explore the physical geography of where we come from, while pieces like "Medusa" by Rose Lemberg and "Chiripas" by José González Vargas look at immigration and the struggles of people who feel they have to leave their homes. Meanwhile, "Your Inheritance Will Taste of Salt" by Karolina Fedyk, "My Sister is a House" by Zoë Medeiros, and "Mother Tongue" by Jessica Jo Horowitz ask how much our genetic makeup defines us, and what makes us like or not like our biological families.

"Larga Distancia" ("Long Distance") by Raquel Castro is a short piece that takes a look at the struggles children and parents can have communicating. "The Telegrapher" by Resoketswe Manenzhe also touches on parents and communication, but in a very different way.

As always, we're interested in resistance and hope for change, and in this quarter we have some great resistance and change pieces, including an essay about protecting trans rights by A. A. McNanara, and several stories: "Poison" by Cyd Athens, "You Are Bleeding" by Alexa Seidel, "The Jubilee" by Sheree Renée Thomas, and "Aging Elements" by Ben Francisco. All of these pieces give me hope.

Our other two essays this round both continue our long term examination of harassment culture. Derek Newman-Stille writes about their experiences with abuse, hate crimes, and police. Mikki Kendall writes about her experiences with the intersections of racism and sexism. Both essays gave me a lot to think about.

We have some just plain fun stories, too. From adventures in noodle shops ("Five Stories in the Monsoon Night" by Nghi Vo, with an illustration by Ora Xu) to  post-apocalyptic cats "Bubbles and His Biped" by Mary Berman) to Mars Rovers who are perfect cinnamon buns and will make your heart break because they are so pure and good ("How to Say I Love You With Wikipedia" by Beth Goder with an illustration by Cat O'Neill). Seriously, though, that last one made me cry in public multiple times during the editing process. You've been warned!

All Best,
Julia Rios, Editor
