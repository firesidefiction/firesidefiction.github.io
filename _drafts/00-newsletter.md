# We're taking a bite out of 2018
## and we're not letting go until it gets better

Hi everybody, happy new year!

<<<<<<< HEAD
We kicked off 2018 with _[Two Years Dead](https://firesidefiction.com/two-years-dead)_, by Kathryn Kania, a sweet and super-cute bit of flash fiction about getting back into the dating game after a setback.

We also published the last chapter of Sarah Gailey’s serial, _[The Fisher of Bones](https://firesidefiction.com/book/the-fisher-of-bones)_. In [Arrival](https://firesidefiction.com/the-fisher-of-bones/chapter-twelve-arrival), Fisher’s band of travelers get to the bitter end of their journey, and have words with the Gods. Or the Gods have words for them. In any case, it’s a gut-punch of an ending — you don’t want to miss it.

2017 was a hell of a year for Fireside. We did a little looking back at everything that happened last year, and we listed our contributors’ wonderful work in our [Awards Eligibility Post for 2017](https://firesidefiction.com/awards-2017). If you’re looking for work to consider for Hugos, Nebulas, and those kinds of things, we’ve got you covered.

We kicked off 2018 with _[Two Years Dead](https://firesidefiction.com/two-years-dead)_, by Kathryn Kania, a sweet and super cute bit of flash fiction about getting back into the dating game after a setback, and then did a massive headfake and followed it up this week with _[Those We Feed](https://firesidefiction.com/those-we-feed)_, a dark and tense tale from Layla Al-Bedawi.

We also published the last chapter of Sarah Gailey’s serial, _[The Fisher of Bones](https://firesidefiction.com/book/the-fisher-of-bones)_. In [Arrival](https://firesidefiction.com/the-fisher-of-bones/chapter-twelve-arrival), Fisher’s band of travelers get to the bitter end of their journey, and have words with the Gods.

If you’re looking for work to consider for Hugos, Nebulas, and other awards, we’ve got a pretty decent TOC for you to look at.

Later this week we’ll be publishing the project we’ve been working on with Amal El-Mohtar and Molly Crabapple—we absolutely cannot wait for you to check it out. In addition to that, we’ll also be starting the (multi-step) process of launching Fireside’s next big project, which we’re hoping will drop in the summer. Suffice it to say for now that I’m really excited about 2018, and if you’re reading this, you’ll be among the first to know about all of the really cool things we’re planning.
