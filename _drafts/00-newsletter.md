# This year is alive
## the gods decree it.

Hi everybody, happy new year!

We kicked off 2018 with _[Two Years Dead](https://firesidefiction.com/two-years-dead)_, by Kathryn Kania, a sweet and super cute bit of flash fiction about getting back into the dating game after a setback.

We also published the last chapter of Sarah Gailey’s serial, _[The Fisher of Bones](https://firesidefiction.com/book/the-fisher-of-bones)_. In [Arrival](https://firesidefiction.com/the-fisher-of-bones/chapter-twelve-arrival), Fisher’s band of travelers get to the bitter end of their journey, and have words with the Gods. Or the Gods have words for them. In any case, it’s a gut-punch of an ending — you don’t want to miss it.

2017 was a hell of a year for Fireside. We did a little looking back at everything that happened last year, and we listed our contributors’s wonderful work in our  [Awards Eligibility Post for 2017](https://firesidefiction.com/awards-2017). If you’re looking for work to consider for Hugos, Nebulas, and those kinds of things, we’ve got you covered.

As always, thanks for reading!
