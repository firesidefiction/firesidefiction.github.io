Welcome, Hugo voters! Please come gather round the fire with us and make yourselves comfy. _Fireside_ is delighted to share with you a sampling of the fabulous fiction and non-fiction we published in 2017. 

In case you’ve never heard of _Fireside_, Brian J. White started it a few years ago as a kickstarter-funded print magazine. Eventually it moved to web and ebook versions, and as of right now in 2018, we’re back to having a print version as well. _Fireside Quarterly_ is launching with the the July/August/September issue. 

_Fireside_ has always had two goals: to publish excellent stories regardless of genre, and to pay our artists and authors well. Brian also cares a lot about boosting new writers and underrepresented voices, so that’s been a big focus from the start, and continues to be a focus as the team has grown. When Brian decided to step down as Editor in the middle of 2017, I was honored to take over that role. I’m a queer Latinx person who loves exploring all the different ways identities intersect. My background both in and out of publishing has always focused on community and inclusivity, so I jumped at the chance to continue that while also going back to editing original fiction (I had been previously been editing poetry and reprints at _Uncanny Magazine_, which was a lot of fun, but for me there’s a special high that comes from editing stories, which I learned during my first professional editing stint as a Senior Fiction Editor at _Strange Horizons_ from 2012 to 2015).

Brian built Fireside from the ground up, so I am taking over a legacy of activism and commitment to great stories, which is wonderful. I walked into a team of excellent people, too. Pablo Defendini, our Publisher, is a stellar human with a background in art and design. He commissions all the original illustrations for Fireside and designs our website, ebooks, and print editions. Elsa Sjunneson-Henry, our Managing Editor, is a deaf-blind fireball of awesome power. She handles a lot of our behind the scenes stuff, but also helps me choose stories, and as of 2018, she’s also started editing some of our non-fiction. Mikki Kendall, who stepped in to edit the special non-fiction features for the 2017 #BlackSpecFic Report, is basically a superhero. I didn’t work directly with her on this because I came in after all her work was done, but she did an amazing job, and I’ve been on panels with her and can attest that she is an amazing human. So that’s Team Fireside for 2017. 

Within this special edition of _Fireside_ you’ll find flash fiction, short stories, novelettes, and a selection of non-fiction pieces. We’ve included the #BlackSpecFic Report by Cecily Kane along with some personal essay reactions to it and a roundtable with the editors of _FIYAH Lit Magazine_ because we wanted to give you a glimpse into the bigger picture. The #BlackSpecFic Report is a big undertaking, but the report itself is just the beginning of the work. If you like what’s included here, we recommend diving into the rest of the essays and interviews, which are all available on our website. We’re also interested in a much larger conversation about inclusivity in publishing, and we’re working to provide more of what we want to see with the things we publish. You’ll find an essay not related to the report, which is by John Wiswell, and is about another aspect of representation we all care deeply about: disability. There are also lots of different voices among the authors of the stories we’re including in this selection. Both new and seasoned writers from different parts of the world and different perspectives. We love seeing the rich variety of human experiences reflected in stories that grip us or take us on adventures, or make us laugh or cry. You’ll find some of this year’s Hugo Finalists like Sarah Gailey and Vina Jie-Min Prasad as well as some stories by new voices like the wondrous and ethereal “River Boy” by Innocent Chizaram Ilo. And then there’s the art. Each of the illustrations included here was specifically commissioned to go with a story we published, and they are stunning. 

We hope you find a new favorite or two in this sampling, and if you like what you see here, there’s plenty more to find. We’re so honored to be here. Thank you for being part of the rich and diverse community of science fiction fandom, and for sharing our enthusiasm for great stories!

All Best,
Julia Rios, Fiction Editor
