Hello again! Another week, and we've got another wonderful story for you. As we teased last week, Mary Robinette Kowal returned to _Fireside Magazine_ with [_Dust to Dust_](https://firesidefiction.com/dust-to-dust), a heartbreaking story about what happens when you mess with forbidden magic. Mary was one of the contributors to _Fireside Magazine_'s first foray into print, way back in the days of 2012, and we couldn't be more pleased to have her back in our pages. Or pixels, I suppose. We won't have actual pages again until July, when we launch _Fireside Quarterly_. 

Speaking of the _Quarterly_, we're hard at work putting it together, and we've announce the TOC for our first issue over on [our Drip page](https://d.rip/fireside). Go check it out, and consider subscribing. Once you see the TOC, I'm sure you'll agree that it's going to be a stellar first issue, and when it's gone, it will be gone—we're only printing enough to cover our subscribers, and maybe have a few copies on hand to give out.

We have more _Quarterly_-related things to announce over the next few weeks, including the artist roster for the first issue, and our nonfiction TOC. That's right, we're expanding beyond the 'fiction' in 'Fireside Fiction' (we may have to do something about our twitter handle and our website url later this year).

A print edition of _Fireside_ is just the beginning. The first issue of _Fireside Quarterly_ drops in July, and it kicks off a publication schedule for the back half of the year for us. You may have heard rumblings from Hillary Monahan, Rachael K. Jones, or Brian on Twitter, but that's only half the story. We'll also have more news on this front in the coming months.

The only way we can bring you stories and artwork every month and, later this year, books is with your support. We don't do ads, we don't do grants, and we don't do rich uncles—Fireside lives and dies by your cash money subscriptions. The fact that we've made it five years is remarkable, and we want to be around for another fifty, so please [consider subscribing](https://firesidefiction.com/#support-fireside).

As always, thanks for reading!

Pablo
