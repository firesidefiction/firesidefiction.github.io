Hello everybody! This week we’ve got a bunch of stuff for you, so strap in, this is a long one!

First, this week’s story is a near-future dystopian tale by Millie Ho. In ‘[_Hehua_](https://firesidefiction.com/hehua),’ a woman navigates a world in which creepy white dudes are not just dominant, but murderously so — but it’s time for a reckoning. _Hehua_ features fantastic artwork by Tesslyn B.

We also published the Amal El-Mohtar/Molly Crabapple project we’ve been hinting at for the last few weeks. It’s an illustrated poem entitled [_Thunderstorm in Glasgow, July 25, 2013_](https://firesidefiction.com/thunderstorm-in-glasgow-july-25-2013), and it is _glorious_ . Check out [Amal’s twitter thread](https://twitter.com/tithenai/status/954029817778917376) about how the poem came to be. If you want to have Molly’s artwork and Amal’s words on your wall, we’ve also made a [poster-sized print available for sale in the Fireside Shop](https://store.firesidefiction.com/products/thunderstorm-in-glasgow-july-25-2013-poster). It’s been so hard to keep this under wraps — we hope you enjoy it!

Julia and I are at ConFusion in Detroit this weekend, where we’ve sponsored some non-alcoholic cocktails at the bar, because booze is fine but you shouldn’t feel excluded if you don’t want any. It’s our way of contributing to a more inclusive and safer community, and we hope to do more of it. So if you’re here, say hi! But also go have some refreshing non-alcoholic drinks at the bar, on us.

And finally: this week we are soft-launching the next phase in Fireside’s evolution. As is our way, we’re letting you all know about it here before we start spreading the word far and wide.

We’re launching a quarterly, high-quality, full-color, illustrated print edition of Fireside. It’s called Fireside Quarterly, and the first issue drops on July 1, 2018.

Fireside Quarterly will include more than 120 pages of stories and artwork. Our plan is to publish three months’ worth of Fireside content in the print edition,  before it hits the website. This is similar to what we do now with our Monthly ebooks subscription, but on a longer timescale.

Each illustration will retain its landscape format from the site, which means it will be printed as a pull-out, triple gatefold insert.
Here are some mockups I photoshopped off of the production files, using some old Fireside content and the printer's dummy I got from our printers:

Every current subscriber to Fireside at the $10 Flame level or higher will be entitled to opt in to a subscription to Fireside Quarterly, so if you’ve been supporting us at $10 or higher, do nothing — you can expect an email in the coming weeks giving you more details about how you can sign up to receive a printed edition of Fireside Quarterly every three months. If you haven’t signed up to be a subscriber, now is your chance! Read on for details.

The first issue of the Quarterly won’t arrive until the summer, but we’re starting our subscription drive now, in order to build up momentum, and because making physical objects is expensive, so the sooner we can reach a sustainable number of subscribers, the better.

This is where you all come in: to kick off the subscription drive, we’re launching a Kickstarter Drip campaign, which is live right now at [d.rip/fireside](https://d.rip/fireside). Check it out and share it far and wide. Our plan is to have it run for a week or so in soft-launch mode, and rely on you all to help spread the word a little bit as drive some initial subscriptions, so that once we do a bigger launch and get some press coverage, we’ll already have some subscribers signed up and it looks like there’s some momentum behind the subscription drive.

Working on this project, I’ve realized how much I miss working on a printed magazine (I used to art direct printed magazines in a past life). Between now and the summer you can expect to see lots and lots of updates on how production for the first issue is going: we’ll unveil the TOC, we’ll do a cover reveal -- all that good stuff. In the meantime, you can find more details about why we’re doing a print magazine, and why now, on our first post over on the Drip campaign page. 

We can’t wait to put the first issue of Fireside Quarterly in your hands come July. We hope you decide to join us on this new venture. Now more than ever, thanks for reading.

Pablo
