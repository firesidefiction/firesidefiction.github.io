Friends, we've got some really big news: _Fireside Magazine_ has been [nominated for a Hugo award in the Best Semiprozine category](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/31/17183718/2018-hugo-award-nominations-science-fiction-fantasy-books
)! This is wonderful news, and I couldn't be prouder of Julia, Brian, Elsa, Mikki, and the work we do with all of our incredible authors and artistsâ€”congratulations to all of them, and to our fellow nominees on a really outstanding ballot. It's a privilege to be able to put out the excellent work _Fireside_ publishes every week with the [direct support from our subscribers](https://firesidefiction.com/#subscribe), and we're grateful that the fan community is recognizing our hard work. We'll see you at Worldcon in San Jose.

In other awards news, we're thrilled to find out that [FIYAH Magazine has won Barrelhouse's Amplifier Award](https://www.barrelhousemag.com/news-and-updates/2018/3/31/2018-barrelhouse-amplifier-awarded-to-fiyah-a-magazine-of-black-speculative-fiction). FIYAH is doing good and important work in the short speculative fiction field as well, and we're glad they're getting recognition too.


This week we published a gut-punch of a story. "[Iyanuoluwa-Mercy of God](https://firesidefiction.com/iyanuoluwa-mercy-of-god)" is Jojo Bee's very first published story, and it's an unflinching look at the African slave trade through the eyes of a Yoruba woman.

We've begun to lay out the first issue of [_Fireside Quarterly_](https://d.rip/fireside). Now that we have all our stories in, we're taking a little time this month to wire up our print production workflow in a way that branches easily off of our website production process. We're still on track to ship the first issue in July, and we can't wait to start sharing more sneak peeks with you soon.

As always, thanks for reading -- see you next week!
