Hey everybody!

Yesterday the kids took us to school with the [March for our Lives](https://firesidefiction.com/by-the-mothers-trunk), a mass demonstration in favor of gun control laws, organized by the survivors of the Parkland school shooting. Marching is important and we are so proud of these kids, but the work doesn’t stop there - lets help them with it.  Register to [vote](https://vote.gov/), and [call your congress person](https://www.5calls.org/issue/action-against-gun-violence). Tell them that it’s time for common sense gun control. It's also time for your Senator, specifically, to step up and defend the ADA by voting down [HR 620](https://www.5calls.org/issue/americans-with-disabilities-act-ada) when it comes up for a vote, and it's waaaay past time that we all got together to tell our elected representatives that we [reject the government's latest actions against transgender people](https://www.5calls.org/issue/trump-ban-transgender-military-troops). Because all of this is related, and the only way we win is by being relentless and doing the work.

Speaking of work, we’ve been hard at it. This week we published “[By the Mother's Trunk](https://firesidefiction.com/by-the-mothers-trunk),” a tense piece of flash fiction by Lisa M. Bradly that explores the cost of giving people what they want. We also published a powerful essay by Elsa Sjunneson-Henry, “[Power Structures Are Meant to Be Broken](https://firesidefiction.com/power-structures-are-meant-to-be-broken)” that explores the frustrations of finding disabled representation.

Next week is the editorial deadline for the first issue of [_Fireside Quarterly_](https://d.rip/fireside). That means that we're getting the final edited stories from each author. We'll then start putting together the layout of the magazine, for sending to the printer in May, ahead of our July shipping date. We get to start sharing in-progress sneak peeks wit you soon!

In the meantime, [subscribe to _Fireside Magazine_](https://firesidefiction.com/#subscribe). Your direct support makes all of our work possible, and makes it so that we can pay our authors, artists, and editors, as much money as we can.

As always, thanks for reading — catch you next week!
