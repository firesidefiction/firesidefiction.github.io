Hey everybody!

This week we opened with "[By the Mother's Trunk](https://firesidefiction.com/by-the-mothers-trunk)," a tense bit of flash from Lisa M. Bradley. It's a story about the price of giving people what they want, and it stars Tillie the Elephant — what more could you want?

We also published a powerful essay from Elsa Sjunneson-Henry this week. In "[Power Structures Are Meant to Be Broken](https://firesidefiction.com/power-structures-are-meant-to-be-broken)," Elsa dismantles the trope of the disabled information broker, and the ever-looming presence of white dudes as a privileged group, even within otherwise marginalized communities.

This Saturday is the [March for our Lives](https://firesidefiction.com/by-the-mothers-trunk), a mass demonstration in favor of gun control laws, organized by the survivors of the Parkland school shooting. These kids are not going to let this go, and neither should we. If you can join a demonstration this Saturday, please and show your support. If you cant be there physically, you can still help by keeping the pressure up with our elected officials — [call those congresscritters again and again](https://www.5calls.org/issue/action-against-gun-violence) and agitate for sensible gun control legislation. Enough is enough.

Next week is the editorial deadline for the first issue of [_Fireside Quarterly_](https://d.rip/fireside). That means that we're getting the final edited stories from each author. We'll then start putting togehter the layout of the magazine, for sending to the printer in May, ahead of our July shipping date. We get to start sharing in-progress sneak peeks wit you soon!

In the meantime, [subscribe to _Fireside Magazine_](https://firesidefiction.com/#subscribe). Your direct support makes all of our work possible, and makes it so that we can pay our authors, artists, and editors, as much money as we can.

As always, thanks for reading — catch you next week!

Pablo
