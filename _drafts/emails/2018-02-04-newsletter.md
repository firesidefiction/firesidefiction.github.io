Hi everyone!

This week we published a piece by Ogbewe Amadin. In [_Riddle_](https://firesidefiction.com/riddle), a little girl learns to consider the facts, question her assumptions, and unlearn the received 'wisdom' she gets form her elders, with the help of her Auntie.

If you're subscribed to our monthly ebook delivery, you received your copy of Fireside Magazine Issue 52 earlier this week, and you got a sneak peek at what we've got in store for you this month: stories by Mary Robinette Kowal, Dominica Phetteplace, Holly Lyn Walrath, and a powerful piece from Phenderson Djèlí Clark, illustrated by Odera Igbokwe, just in time for Black History month. 

If you haven't subscribed, [consider doing so](https://firesidefiction.com/#support-fireside)—your money helps us pay our authors, artists, and staff, to keep bringing you these amazing stories. Better yet, subscribe to [Fireside Quarterly](https://d.rip/fireside) and help us get a head start on spinning up production on our printed edition.

As always, thanks for reading!

Pablo
