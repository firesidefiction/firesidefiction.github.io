Hello everybody!

This past Tuesday we published “[The Secret Lives of the Nine Negro Teeth of George Washington](https://firesidefiction.com/the-secret-lives-of-the-nine-negro-teeth-of-george-washington)” by Phenderson Djèlí Clark. Timed to go up for Presidents' Day and Black History month here in the US, it's a beautiful and engrossing series of vignettes celebrating the often unseen contributors to American history. It features a fantastic illustration by Odera Igbokwe, and it's well worth taking a few minutes to read it.

We also published a nonficiton essay by Djèlí, "[Imagining the Past: Speculative Fiction and the Recovering of Black History](https://firesidefiction.com/imagining-the-past-speculative-fiction-and-the-recovering-of-black-history), which goes into some of the real-world history behind how Black people have always used ficiton to combat white supremacy. It's a fascinating read, and a great jumping-off point for further research.

This week we also announced that we'd be opening up an [ongoing call for illustrator portfolios](https://firesidefiction.com/were-open-to-artist-submissions). One of the things I'd like to achieve for Fireside is to make it a vibrant market for illustrators in the same way it is for authors, and one of the most fun aspects of taking over Fireside has been working as its art director. But just as with prose, the world of illustration can also be exclusionary to marginalized folks. One of the ways in which we can proactively address this issue is by broadening the entry point for artists, and that's just what we've done—if you're an artist, the only requirement for putting your work in front of me for consideration is that you have a website with your portfolio on it.

If you or someone you know wants to submit their portfolio, just [fill out this form](https://airtable.com/shrDve4OIlTFCbFmQ), and that's it. In a little under a week since we posted the announcement, we've gotten tons of great submissions, and it's been hard to not drop everything to go look at the new art every time our Slack bot pings us to tell us someone has added a new portfolio.

Finally, this past week has seen lots of talk and activity around the issue of gun violence in the US. Personally, I'm a supporter of banning all guns, period. But I know that's not a realistic position here in the United States. However, it _is_ realistic to acknowledge that the NRA is an organization that uses fear, racist rhetoric, distorted facts, and above all money to push forward an agenda that benefits no one except merchants of death like gun and ammunition manufacturers. So aside from calling your representatives to demand effective gun control laws (you can use [5calls.org](https://www.5calls.org/issue/federal-ban-assault-weapons) for that too!), and refusing to vote for politicians who take the NRA's money, you can also make your voice heard with [the corporations who partner with the NRA to offer discounts on their services](https://thinkprogress.org/corporations-nra-f0d8074f2ca7/).

Next week, we're publishing the last of the stories in February's Issue 52 of Fireside Magazine. If you want to get your hands on Issue 53 before those stories go up on the site in March, [subscribe to Fireside Magazine](https://firesidefiction.com/#subscribe). And if you want your stories in print, a full three months before they go up on the site, you'll want to [subscribe to Fireside Quarterly](https://d.rip/fireside)—you're still in time to receive the first issue, which drops in July.

As always, thanks for reading, see you next week!

Pablo
