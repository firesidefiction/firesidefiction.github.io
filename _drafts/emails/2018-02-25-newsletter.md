Hello everybody!

This past Tuesday was Presidents' Day in the US. This is usually held on or around George Washington's birthday, so we thought it would be the perfect day to publish “[The Secret Lives of the Nine Negro Teeth of George Washington](https://firesidefiction.com/the-secret-lives-of-the-nine-negro-teeth-of-george-washington)” by Phenderson Djèlí Clark. This series of vignettes is a magical take on a hard truth that the United States needs to reckon with, when it comes to its treatment of Black people. It features a fantastic illustration by Odera Igbokwe, and it's well worth taking a few minutes to read it.

This week we also announced that we'd be opening up an [ongoing call for illustrator portfolios](https://firesidefiction.com/were-open-to-artist-submissions). One of the things I'd like to achieve for Fireside is to make it a vibrant market for illustrators in the same way it is for authors, and one of the most fun aspects of taking over Fireside has been working as its art director. But just as with prose, the world of illustration can also be exclusionary to marginalized folks. One of the ways in which we can proactively address this issue is by broadening the entry point for artists, and that's jus what we've done—if you're an artist, the only requirement for putting your work in front of me for consideration is that you have a website with your portfolio on it. If you or someone you know wants to submit their portfolio, just [fill out this form](https://airtable.com/shrDve4OIlTFCbFmQ), and that's it. In a little under a week since we posted the announcement, we've gotten tons of great submissions, and it's been hard to not drop everything to go look at the new art every time our Slack bot pings us to tell us someone has added a new portfolio.

Next week, we're publishing the last of the stories in February's Issue 52 of Fireside Magazine. If you want to get your hands on Issue 53 before those stories go up on the site in March, [subscribe to Fireside Magazine](https://firesidefiction.com/#subscribe). And if you want your stories in print, a full three months before they go up on the site, you'll want to [subscribe to Fireside Quarterly](https://d.rip/fireside)—you're still in time to receive the first issue, which drops in July.

As always, thanks for reading, see you next week!

Pablo
