Hello everybody!

This week, we published a flash fiction piece by Dominique Phetteplace. “[How I Got Published (12 Tips from a Bestselling Author)](https://firesidefiction.com/how-i-got-published)” gets pretty meta: there’s some good advice mixed in with the gods, aliens, and magics in there, go check it out!

In case you missed it last week, we published Mary Robinette Kowal’s moving story, “[Dust to Dust](https://firesidefiction.com/dust-to-dust).” And next week we’ve got an incredible story by Phenderson Djèlí Clark, just in time for  the President’s day holiday in the US. You won’t want to miss it.

As we continue working on the print edition of Fireside, and we firm up our subscription strategy after last December’s big reshuffle, we’ve started getting back to the idea of monthly issues of Fireside. When we launched last year’s site redesign, we went all in with a pared-down, stream-like weekly publishing strategy. We wanted to see how that would work for us. Now that we’re a year or so in, we’ve been refining our approach, and we thing the weekly free content on the site is a great foundation. Everyone gets free, weekly stories online; [_Fireside Magazine_ subscribers](https://firesidefiction.com/#support-fireside) receive the monthly ebook with all the Month’s stories before they go online; and [_Fireside Quarterly_ subscribers](https://d.rip/fireside) will get three months’ worth off stories and artwork in a beautiful, premium printed magazine, before they go into the monthly _Magazine_. It’s like a matryoshka doll: Weekly fits into Monthly, fits into Quarterly. What can I say: I’m a graphic designer, I like organizing things `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

We’ve been quiet on the current events front for a bit, but just because we sometimes need to take a step back from the chaos and take care of ourselves, doesn’t mean the world stops spinning. In the US, the healthcare fight is still going, even though the news has moved on. Despite having failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the Republican Party continues to quietly chip at protections for our most vulnerable and marginalized, most recently through HR 620, the so-called “ADA Education and Reform Act.” Among other things, HR 620 substantially undermines the Americans with Disabilities And, a landmark piece of civil rights legislation. [Here’s Senator Tammy Duckworth with an op-ed giving an overview of what’s going on](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/congress-is-on-the-offensive-against-americans-with-disabilities/2017/10/17/f508069c-b359-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html?utm_term=.7852023bd985). The ACLU has [a good primer on why this new proposed law is harmful](https://www.aclu.org/other/hr-620-myths-and-truths-about-ada-education-and-reform-act), and if you’re a US cities, our own Elsa Sjunnesson Henry provides some first-person perspective on why it’s so important to call your representatives and demand that they vote against HR 620 in [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/snarkbat/status/963425641810092033).

As always, thanks for reading, see you next week!
