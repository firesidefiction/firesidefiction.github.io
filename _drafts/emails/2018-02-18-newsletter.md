Hello everybody!

This week, we published a flash fiction piece by Dominique Phetteplace. “[How I Got Published (12 Tips from a Bestselling Author)](https://firesidefiction.com/how-i-got-published)” gets pretty meta: there’s some good advice mixed in with the gods, aliens, and magics in there, go check it out!

As we continue working on the first issue of [_Fireside Quarterly_](https://d.rip/fireside), we're starting to look ahead past the first issue. With that in mind, we've announced that we'll be [open for submissions the week of April 23 to 27](https://firesidefiction.com/april-2018-submissions).

We’ve been quiet on the current events front for a bit, but just because we sometimes need to take a step back from the chaos and take care of ourselves, doesn’t mean the world stops spinning. In the US, the healthcare fight is still going, even though the news has moved on. Despite having failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the Republican Party continues to quietly chip at protections for our most vulnerable and marginalized, most recently through HR 620, the so-called “ADA Education and Reform Act.” Among other things, HR 620 substantially undermines the Americans with Disabilities And, a landmark piece of civil rights legislation. [Here’s Senator Tammy Duckworth with an op-ed giving an overview of what’s going on](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/congress-is-on-the-offensive-against-americans-with-disabilities/2017/10/17/f508069c-b359-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html?utm_term=.7852023bd985), and the ACLU has [a good primer on why this new proposed law is harmful](https://www.aclu.org/other/hr-620-myths-and-truths-about-ada-education-and-reform-act). Earlier this week, the House of Representatives voted to pass HR 620, and now it goes to the Senate. If you're in the US, our own Elsa Sjunnesson-Henry provides some first-person perspective on why it’s so important to call your senators and demand that they vote against HR 620 in [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/snarkbat/status/963425641810092033).

If you're like me, you need a little help making phone calls to your representatives. [5calls.org](https://www.5calls.org) makes it super simple to get it done in around five minutes.

Next week we’ve got an incredible story by Phenderson Djèlí Clark, just in time for the President’s Day holiday in the US. You won’t want to miss it.

As always, thanks for reading, see you next week!

Pablo
