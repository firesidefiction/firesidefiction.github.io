Hello everybody!

This week we published [_A Legal Alien_](https://firesidefiction.com/a-legal-alien), by Maya Kanwal. This short piece tackles the immigration situation head-on, and shows us how ICE can terrorize a community and turn people like you and me against each other. It's a tough read, but it's essential reading.

As I'm sure you've noticed, the immigration debate has been on our mindsâ€”most of the things we've published throughout January deal with people and the places where they belong. To round things out, Julia put together a round table discussion with Layla Al-Bedawi, Millie Ho, and Maya Kanwal to talk about their [_Immigrant Experiences in Fiction and Real Life_](https://firesidefiction.com/immigrant-experiences-roundtable).

The response to [_Thunderstorm in Glasgow, July 25 2013_](https://firesidefiction.com/thunderstorm-in-glasgow-july-25-2013) has been phenomenal. We feel to gratified that people are enjoying this project, and are grateful to everyone who has bought [a print in our shop](). We hope to do more things like this in the coming year.

The soft-launch week of our Drip subscription drive for [Fireside Quarterly](https://d.rip/fireside) has been fantastic so far. We've got a few subscribers, and we're gearing up to send out press requests, start posting updates, and begin making more noise. In the meanitme, I've spent part of this week putting together a short video for the Drip page, which I hope to post next week.

We're also hard at work getting the first issue of Fireside Quarterly ready to go to press, of course. I've started commissioning illustrators, while Julia and Elsa have put together our TOC (Brian is making us all snacks). We've got the shape of it, and we'll be working over the next month or so to lay it all down.

Pablo
