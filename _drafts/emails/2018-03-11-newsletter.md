Holaaaa!

We kicked off March in fine style this week, with “[Flow](https://firesidefiction.com/flow)” by Marissa Lingen. This beautiful, aching story about the environment, disability, and mortality. It’s accompanied by a breathtaking illustration from Galen Dara, and all the wonderful things they’re saying about it online are true—go check it out if you haven’t read it.

Awards nominations for the Hugo Awards are coming to a close soon, so we put out a twitter thread with some suggestions for those of you who haven’t done the deed yet.  We’re rooting for all of the work we published in 2017, of course, but in particular, I’d love to see [The 2016 #BlackSpecFic Report by Cecily Kane](https://firesidefiction.com/blackspecfic-2016) nominated for Best Related Work. The #BlackSpecFic Report is crucial work for our field, and we think Cecily deserves to be recognized for it.

This week there was also some movement in Florida on gun legislation, but the clown show in Washington DC seems to think they can just move on.  That we’ll forget the stakes on this one. That we’ll give the NRA a pass, just like we’ve always done. They’re wrong. [Call your representative again](https://www.5calls.org/issue/federal-ban-assault-weapons). Demand that they do their damn jobs, and pass legislation to address the bizarre and ridiculous gun situation in this country.

And now, a chaser: weasels, roaches, ferrets… no matter what you call them, we’ve all got them: the little voices in our head telling us we’re not good enough, or that we don’t matter. Adventure cartoonist Lucy Bellwood took her demon by the tail and made a fantastic comic, _100 Demon Dialogues_, about shouting down those negative voices. It’s one of my favorite comics from the last few years. She’s packaged it up into a beautiful hardcover and softcover collection. You can snag a copy for yourself [right here](https://100-demon-dialogues.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders).

Next week we’re back with the next story from Issue 53, a kickass piece by Arkady Martine.
