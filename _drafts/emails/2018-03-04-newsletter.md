Hello everybody!

This week we published “[knick knack, knick knack](https://firesidefiction.com/knick-knack-knick-knack),” by Holly Lyn Walrath. It's a lovely story about growing up, and about a parent watching their child forge their own way in the world. It's about mourning, but not in a sad way, if that makes sense. Go read it if you haven't checked it out yet, it's a sweet read.

It's a new month, and that means that our _Fireside Magazine_ subscribers just received our upcoming Issue 53 in their inbox, featuring stories by Marissa Lingen, Arkady Martine, Lisa M. Bradley, Jojo Bee, and new artwork by Galen Dara. If you aren't a Fireside subscriber, you'll have to wait until we post the stories on the site over the next few weeks, but you can get in now for Issue 54 in April by [subscribing on our site](htts://firesidefiction.com/#subscribe), or by [subscribing to _Fireside Quarterly_ on Drip](https://d.rip/fireside).

Last year, when we published the 2016 [#BlackSpecFic Report](https://firesidefiction.com/blackspecfic), I said we'd be iterating on our processes as we explored what works and what doesn't for increasing diversity and inclusion in the work we publish. A lot of that work has surrounded our submissions process. As we get ready to open for submissions again, we're iterating on our approach to our first readers, too. Instead of having a steady group of first readers, we're putting out a call to build up a pool of people who want to read for us. That way we don't always lean on the same people, and we help maintain a diverse and vibrant group of first readers on an ongoing basis. Elsa has all the details, so if you're interested in reading for us, [check out her post and fill in the form](https://firesidefiction.com/call-for-first-readers).

Speaking of forms, we continue to get a metric ton of illustrator portfolio submissions every day. If you or someone you know wants to submit their portfolio, just [fill out this form](https://airtable.com/shrDve4OIlTFCbFmQ), and that's it.

Despite our terrible, no-good politicians' deepest wishes, the clamor for an end to gun violence, and against the NRA, specifically, is not going away. Last week, we linked you to [a list of companies](https://thinkprogress.org/corporations-nra-f0d8074f2ca7/) that offer discounts to NRA members, and many businesses decided to terminate that relationship. However, FedEx has not, and has actually [doubled down](http://time.com/5178103/fedex-nra-boycott/) on their support for the NRA. So we've stopped using FedEx as a shipment option for the [Fireside Shop](https:/shop.firesideficiton.com). The NRA is holding an entire country hostage with fear-mongering and racist rhetoric, at the expense of lives and to the benefit of gun manufacturers. That needs to end.

As always, thanks for reading, see you next week!

Pablo
