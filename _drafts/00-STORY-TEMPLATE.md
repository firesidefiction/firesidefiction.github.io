Add a blank line between paragraphs, otherwise the line will be a regular carriage return, not the start of a new paragraph.

Use single underscores or asterisks for *emphasis*. Use double underscores or asterisks for **strong emphasis**. Write links like this: [link text](http://url.com).

Use four dashes for section breaks: `----`

----

Use a `>` for blockquotes

> Like this.

To add a footnote you add `[^1]` in the body of the text, and `[^1]: This is my glorious and most important footnote` at the bottom of your markdown file.
