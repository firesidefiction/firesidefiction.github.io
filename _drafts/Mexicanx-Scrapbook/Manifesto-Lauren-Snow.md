**Lauren Snow on the Mexicanx Initiative Manifesto**

In a different world, The Mexicanx Initiative would simply have been a celebration of the unique, visionary perspectives of Mexicanx Creatives. But unfortunately, we don’t live in that world. We’re living in a world where the lives and bodies of our families and communities are in danger, where the word “Mexican” has been sharpened and perverted into a slur. Celebrating Mexicanx has always been political, but in Trump’s America, the stakes have shot up in a deadly way.

John and I have worked together on activist causes before, and he knew that since Trump’s Zero Tolerance policy was announced, I had traveled several times to the border, working on projects to help shape the narrative about immigrants and asylum seekers. In light of this, he reached out to me with an overview of the areas he felt we should address. I quickly wrote up the statement and he delivered it at Worldcon's Opening Ceremonies.

Here is the text of the Manifesto:

It is impossible to stand together today, as Mexicanx creators, and not acknowledge the pain, turmoil, and terror felt right now by our immigrant sisters and brothers, inflicted upon them by the President of the United States. We unequivocally condemn Donald Trump’s decision to tear children from their parents, and we are not fooled into thinking the situation is now over. We additionally condemn any government policy of indefinite family detention - to hold families in jails reminiscent of Japanese interment camps, a shameful stain on our history. And finally, we condemn and reject the ongoing criminalization and dehumanization of immigrants seeking safety, opportunity, and freedom for themselves and their families.

In the face of such evil, it is difficult to know what to do. As artists, writers, and creators, we know the transformative power of story to shape the course of what is possible in the world. We commit to harness our rage and heartbreak as we witness this injustice unfolding before us into creative works of power and hope, and to channel our actions now to bend the arc of history toward justice.
