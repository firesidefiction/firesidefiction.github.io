**Xup!**

The Mexicanx Initiative's 42 attending artists, authors, and fans came into Worldcon 76 strong and united, with John Picacio reading a statement by Lauren Raye Snow at the Opening Ceremonies. While John read Lauren's moving words, the Initiative's members stood in rows behind him on the stage, arms linked in X formations. The message was unity, strength, and a rejection of hate. 

We went from the Opening Ceremonies to our reception party in the ASFA suite at the Fairmont. The reception had amazing food lovingly prepared by Héctor González, and we all got Mexicanx Initiative badge ribbons, stickers designed by Smok, lucha libre figures from José Luis Zárate, copies of _A Larger Reality_ from Libia Brenda, and perhaps most exciting to many of us: invitations to the Hugo Losers Party from Geroge R. R. Martin. By the end of the evening, all of us knew that this experience was something far more special than we had dreamed, and the gesture of Xing up became our shorthand for that rush of belonging.
