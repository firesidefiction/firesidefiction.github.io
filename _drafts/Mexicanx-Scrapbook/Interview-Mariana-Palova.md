**What kind of creative work do you do?**

 I am a digital artist and fantasy writer. My work is focused on occult arts, cultural diversity, mythology, and personal explorations of symbols and different kinds of magic.

 **Had you ever been to a Worldcon before?**

 No! This was my first time, and it's been, by far, one of the best experiences of my professional career.

 **What did you expect being part of the Initiative would be like? How did your experience compare with that expectation?**

 Honestly, I didn't know what to expect; I've been part of art collectives before, but I've never felt this level of unity and solidarity between so many artists and writers. The Initiative is one of a kind, definitely.

**Tell us about one highlight moment of your WorldCon experience.**

Probably, being on the panel of Artists and Writers that John organized. That was my first experience talking in an international forum, and I had so much fun! I realized that I was totally capable of talking about my work and my upcoming book to foreign people (for me, of course) and that made me feel really happy.

**Recommend any or all of the following: a song, a written work, a piece of visual art, and a movie. Tell us why you love them!**

A song: “White Owl” by Josh Garrels. This song makes me cry all the time. It's really nostalgic for me because I started to write my book, _Nation of the Beasts_, while listening to it. It reminds me a lot of my main character, Elisse.

A book: _White Fang_. A simple classic, but this book, my favorite, is the fuel of my crazy love of nature and wild creatures’ perspectives.

A movie: _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_. Best movie ever. I have watched it like ten times, and I always laugh like crazy.

**Where should new people start familiarizing themselves with your work?**

Even though I've been an artist for almost ten years, I think that my book, _Nation of the Beasts_, represents very well what I am and what my world is. This a dark fantasy book, set in our real world; it started out self-published in Spanish, but now the rights have been sold in both Spanish and English and I'm hoping to start my writing career with a good pace!
