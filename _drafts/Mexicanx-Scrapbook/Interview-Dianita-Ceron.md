**Please introduce yourself to us and tell us where you grew up, and where you live now. Where can we find you on social media?**

My name is Diana Vargas-Sampieri but my friends call me Dianita. I use the last name Cerón on social media (it’s my husband’s last name). I was born and raised in the city of Veracruz in Mexico and I’ve been living in Texas for almost 4 years.

**What kind of creative work do you do?**

I’m a traditional artist with a special love for graphite, ink, and painting with acrylics and oils. I create art and small stories inspired by the incredible people in my life, they have taught me to stay strong, kind, and respectful of other people and our world. I try to portray women who protect worlds where there are lots of normal and magical creatures.

I’d love to inspire people of all ages with images where kindness is a strength!

**Had you ever been to a Worldcon before?**

No, Worldcon 76 was my first Worldcon ever!

**What did you expect being part of the Initiative would be like? How did your experience compare with that expectation?**

I arrived hoping to meet new people and find new opportunities for my art. In the end, my experience was a million times more intense than I expected. I realized that the path I’m following with my art feels right. I returned home humbler and more inspired by the works of the artists and authors from the Initiative who I met in person during the four days I attended the convention.

**Tell us about a highlight of your Worldcon experience.**

I feel the highlight moment of my Worldcon experience was being on stage with my new Mexicanx Initiative family. With every word that John read from our statement I realized I had a big responsibility to represent the values we, the Mexican people, hold deep in our hearts. Standing there, linking our arms and being welcomed and supported by this wonderful community was the biggest moment of my time at the convention!

**Recommend any or all of the following: a song, a written work, a piece of visual art, and a movie. Tell us why you love them!**

Song: I’m bad with music! If I had to recommend a song it would be from Mexico:

[“Cielito Lindo”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cielito_Lindo) - It’s a song that makes me happy!


Written Work:  I haven’t read as much as I’d like to, but based on the passion of my fellow Mexicanx Initiative authors I would definitely recommend reading their works! I highly recommend _The Legend of Polloman_ by Gonzalo Alvarez!

Visual piece of art: I’m seriously bad at picking just one.

[“Pegasus Befriends the Muses”](http://www.juliebell.com/portfolio/items/pegasus-befriends-the-muses/) by Julie Bell. She’s one of my favorite artists ever; her art is a blend of many things I love!

[“Casita de dulces II”](http://www.artelibre.net/obras/13552) by Guillermo Lorca. I love this piece because of the juxtaposition of innocence and decay which is very characteristic of his art.

[“La Valiente”](http://www.johnpicacio.com/portfolio/2018/valiente.html) by John Picacio. This is a reinterpretation of El Valiente which is a Loteria card featuring the classic image of a macho man. John turned it into an image of a fierce and elegant woman and I can’t stop looking at her!

[“Huor and Hurin approaching Gondolin”](http://www.donatoart.com/gallery/gondolin.html) by Donato Giancola. It’s one of the pieces I would love to study inch by inch because of its beautiful composition and the colors only he could manage to achieve!

Movie: I’m not the best source for movie recommendations, but I would definitely say _Pan’s Labyrinth_! Written and directed by Guillermo del Toro

**What was the funniest thing that happened during your trip?**

Losing a bag containing my business card holder for my Art Show panel and then realizing, after the Art Show reception, that I left it in the car that morning!

**Where should new people start familiarizing themselves with your work?**

My Patreon: [patreon.com/artbydianita](http://www.patreon.com/artbydianita) - With Patreon I’m trying to build a community around my work where I share sketches, ideas and more personal thoughts. It’s a beautiful way to share my growth with people who have faith in my art and my stories!
