**What kind of creative work do you do?**

I'm an independent producer in film, TV, and the performing arts and a writer and curator.

**Had you ever been to a Worldcon before?**

No.

**What did you expect being part of the Initiative would be like? How did your experience compare with that expectation?**

I had no expectations other than to learn and be supportive.

**Tell us about one highlight moment of your Worldcon experience.**

The call to action at the open of the event was very powerful.

**Recommend any or all of the following: a song, a written work, a piece of visual art, and a movie. Tell us why you love them!**

Besides _Coco_, films I recommend are any film from 1939, and work by Howard Hawks, Preston Sturgis, Frank Capra, John Ford, Ida Lupino, Patricia Riggen, and films from Mexico's Golden Era, especially featuring Maria Felix or Elsa Aguirre.

For music, songs by Agustin Lara, Violetta Parra; and explore the classical music of Mexico and Latin America with music composed by Carlos Chavez, Marquez, Samuel Zyman, Gabriela Ortiz, Ginestera, Moncayo, and the salon music of the 1900s.

**Where should new people start familiarizing themselves with your work?**
