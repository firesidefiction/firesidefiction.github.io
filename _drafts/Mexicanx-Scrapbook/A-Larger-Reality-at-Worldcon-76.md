**A Larger Reality at Worldcon 76**

Part of the Initiative's magic was that way that it brought people and projects together. Before the Intitiative, many of us didn't know each other, but once we knew that we were part of a group, we began working together to support each other and make cool things.

Libia Brenda, an author and editor from Mexico City, had the idea to make a sampling of Mexicanx Initiative stories. Her initial plan was to do something like a fanzine with fiction from several Initiative members. When she started asking people if they'd like to participate, a whole anthology of awesome stories came together. Libia included a comic of her own, as a group, we all pulled together to make sure every piece was translated into English or Spanish (depending on the original language), and when Libia mentioned that she was going to pay printers out of her own pocket, we set up a quick crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter.

In the end Libia printed a tiny run of 200 hard copy flipbooks, which we gave to our Kickstarter backers, members of the Initiative, and some friends and sponsors of the Initiative at Worldcon. But we also made [both the English and Spanish versions of the anthology available for free](https://www.mexicanxinitiative.com/), which was always Libia's vision!

We had so much fun making this, and we were overwhelmed by the community support from Worldcon attendees. Everyone who contributed stories and translations to this anthology originally signed up to provide content for free, but by the time we'd finished our Kickstarter, we'd received enough money that all the authors could be paid at a professional rate according the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America! And that's not all! We paid our translators, editors, and deisgners, too!

Here are some of the experiences of Intitiative members who were involved in the anthology.
