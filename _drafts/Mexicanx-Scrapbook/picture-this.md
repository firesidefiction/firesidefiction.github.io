**Picture this**
by Smok

Picture a shy Mexican girl in a strange place full of people from another galaxy.   
Visualize her, a little bit nervous, building armor out of a lanyard, ribbons and a badge with “La Calavera” —    
the perfect coat of arms for her breastplate.

Watch her, in the corner taking a selfie and sending it to her father to make him feel proud.  
Then, experience the warmest welcome that ever existed from her new brother.  
The one who built a portal and left it open so that she and others didn’t have to climb a wall.

Never forget the moment when almost fifty Mexicanxs crossed their arms in unity,  
A statement, the beginning of a revolution, a fixed point in time that hatred will never be able to undo.

Smell the juicy carnitas and tortillas, taste the strong and sweet flavor of wine and una nueva familia,  
Hear the sound of good conversations, talk in Spanglish.   
And then, return to your hotel with a heartfelt feeling y con un mono de lucha libre in your hand.

Don’t be surprised at a room full of people waiting to hear a reading in Spanish.  
But you can be surprised at how the characters of the stories you hear leave the room along with you.  
Now they will go with you wherever you go, and always be there if you ever need their help.

Can you see how fortunate this girl is?   
For having the opportunity to eat pho for the first time with a moon goddess with the heart of Frida Khalo, and a wise and magical friend who paints the dragons that live in her jardin.

Look, how the weekend goes fast.  Days full of ancient knowledge, and nights full of golden beers.  
Watch closely the atmosphere that we build, thick and strong, like a dome.  
We cannot hear the screams from outside because our minds and hearts make a louder sound.

See the colors of the spirits that live in the sculptures and hanging paintings,   
And all the friendly faces at the tables.  
Remember the old books, new books, lonely books, and the books that you fell in love with, but can’t bring home because there is no more space in your suitcase.

Don’t hold back your tears when you watch the Hugos, please, let it all out.   
Imagine your friends being up there, yourself being up there,   
Because that’s a future that can be close enough.

Remember the parties, remember the food and deep talks.  
Remember the kind souls you encountered for a short time,  
Raise a glass por tu  familia and new friends, and don’t worry: you will meet them again.

Picture a shy Mexican girl returning home, daydreaming and feeling like she found her place in the world.

And now at the count of three you will wake up,   
Because we have to keep working hard,   
We have to make a bigger portal.  
One, two, three,  
See you in Dublin.
