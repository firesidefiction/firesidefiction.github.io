**Where did you grow up/where do you live now? Where can we find you on social media?**

I was born in El Paso, Texas and grew up in Las Cruces, New Mexico. For the last twenty-five years my home has been Denver, Colorado. We are a family of mojados. My dad’s parents fled the civil war in Mexico and my mother was for a while, an indocumentada, before she became a US citizen.

 **What kind of creative work do you do?**

 I write short stories, novels and I paint. I’ve also done gigs as an editor.

 **Had you ever been to a WorldCon before?**

 No.

**What did you expect being part of the Initiative would be like? How did your experience compare with that expectation?**

I didn’t know what to expect other than meet writers from Mexico. They were a great bunch as were the writers and artists that I met from this side of the border.

**Tell us about one highlight moment of your WorldCon experience.**

 When I was signing books, a couple of friends that I hadn’t seen in eighteen years had driven from Richmond just to see me. That was a wonderful surprise.

**Recommend any or all of the following: a song, a written work, a piece of visual art, and a movie. Tell us why you love them!**

My favorite book is _Man’s Search for Meaning_ by Viktor E. Frankl since he explains how we can cope with uncertainties and injustices by believing that we have a purpose in life and that love is the most powerful force in the universe.

**Tell us about a strange moment of your trip?**

I was buying groceries at the urban Safeway in downtown San Jose when through a window I saw one of the local homeless keel over and fall into the street. A Safeway employee went out and put a yellow “wet floor” hazard sign by the homeless guy so he wouldn’t be run over before the EMTs arrived.

**Where should new people start familiarizing themselves with your work?**
