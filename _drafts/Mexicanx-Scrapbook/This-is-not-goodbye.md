Worldcon 76 is over, but for the Mexicanx Initiative familia, the convention was just the beginning! We want to thank everyone who sponsored the Initiative, everyone who came to see us read and listen to us speak, everyone who bought our art and books, everyone who cares about making sure that fandom is a global community, and everyone who is reading this right now! Yes, this means you! Thank you!

And now here's Smok to remind us of how much more there is to come...
