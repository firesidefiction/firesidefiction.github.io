**Where did you grow up and where do you live now? Where can we find you on social media?**

I grew up and still live in Port Arthur, TX, the devil’s armpit. I'm first-generation Mexican American as my parents immigrated over 23 years ago. I can be found as @gonzzink on Instagram and Twitter.

**What kind of creative work do you do?**

I create video games, illustrations, and graphic novels, and am currently working on my Mexican folklore adventure graphic novel series, _The Legend of Polloman_.

**Had you ever been to a Worldcon before?**

I had never been to or even heard of Worldcon till this one!   

**What did you expect being part of the Initiative would be like? How did your experience compare with that expectation?**

I honestly had no idea other than just getting to booth next to other famous Mexican artists that I would get to chat with. Instead I found more than that, I found a family.

**Tell us about one highlight moment of your WorldCon experience.**

Dancing to Selena with people I had only known for four days (that I now consider family) at an exclusive party hosted by George R. R. Martin.

**Recommend any or all of the following: a song, a written work, a piece of visual art, and a movie. Tell us why you love them!**

“Sleepy Tea” by Chon. It's a group of Latinos from SoCal making amazing instrumental math rock music. (One of their songs played in the background at the Olympics!)

The animated movie _Nova Seed_ by Nick DiLiberto. He animated the entire movie, on paper, by himself. Enough said.

**Where should new people start familiarizing themselves with your work?**

The official website, [https://legendofpolloman.com](https://legendofpolloman.com) is the home for everything Polloman! My personal website [https://gonzzink.com](https://gonzzink.com) has some of my other personal work, and [https://www.macuastudios.com](https://www.macuastudios.com) is my video game studio hosting Borders, my internationally exhibited art game influenced by my parents’ immigration story.
