Héctor made seven salsas for the Mexicanx Initiative Reception, all of different spice levels. Here are all seven with complete descriptions:

**Picard de Gallo, Make It Salsa** — Tomatoes, shallots, garlic, avocado, red wine vinegar and piment d’Espelette to add some heat to it.
**Pain level:** almost null. Like being lightly swatted with a rain lily.

**Soylent Verde** — My take on salsa verde, using roasted tomatillos, onions, garlic, serrano peppers, cilantro and avocado oil to enhance the creaminess. No humans were harmed when making this salsa. Promise.
**Pain level:** Very low. Imagine writing a letter and the pen slightly slips your fingers, twisting them.

**Obi Juan Chipotle** — Roasted tomatoes with decadent chipotle peppers in adobo.
**Pain level:** Low. A fly is bothering you and you try to swat it away with your hand but by accident hit a wall.

**Ankh-Morpork’s Finest Sauce** — A spicy sludge for the famed city. A dozen different home smoked peppers (árbol, pasilla, chipotle, cherry, ancho) with roasted garlic and chili oil.
**Pain level:** Medium. You just woke up and you’re heading to the bathroom. You forgot that skateboard and stub your toe. You cry a little bit but hold on as you need to go pee.

**Melange/Spice** — A blue salsa inspired by _Dune_. Butterfly pea flowers steeped with garlic, herbs and fiery habaneros. Agar agar was added to emulate a gelatinous consistency.
**Pain level:** You are finishing cooking a meal. You turn the page of your cookbook and a dreaded paper cut happens. To make things worse, you were handling hot peppers and lemons. The cookbook editor cackles with joy as another one of his children has tasted blood again.

**Tears in the Rain** — A jalapeño pepper and garlic emulsion with finely chopped smoked ghost peppers to add those tears in the rain effect.
**Pain level:** You’re walking downstairs and recalled you forgot something upstairs. You twist your bad ankle. It hurts, badly.

**Dracarys** — Made with Carolina reapers, pineapple vinegar and hibiscus flowers. The hottest salsa of the bunch.
**Pain level:** The twisted ankle gives way and you tumble down the stairs. You also were wearing only a towel. You end up at the bottom of the stairs, naked and in pain. You hear a gasp and your realtor is showing your place to a family of four. The grandma faints.
