**Artists of the Mexicanx Initiative**

The Mexicanx Initiative included a lot of different kinds of creators, but of course any group hand picked by a visual artist like John Picacio is going to have a bunch of ridiculously talented visual artists in it!

John arranged for the Mexicanx Initiative to have display space in the exhibitors hall, and every artist in the Initiative was invited to share the booth and display their work. Here are a few of the Initiative artists's experiences.
