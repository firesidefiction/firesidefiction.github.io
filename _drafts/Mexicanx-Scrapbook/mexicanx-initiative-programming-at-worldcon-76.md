**Mexicanx Initiative Programming at Worldcon 76**

This is a guide to some of the program items that showcased Mexicanx Initiative members and their work at Worldcon 76 in August of 2018.  

Many of the Initiative members were also on program items that weren’t directly related to the Mexicanx Initiative, but this guide focused on  listing things that had a direct connection to the Initiative because they featured multiple members, were focused on one member’s work, or were proposed by a member.

This guide was originally emailed to all Initiative members before the convention so that they'd have an idea of where to find each other, but now that the convention is over it's also a great record of the presence this Initiative had at the convention overall.

**Latinx? Mexicanx? Hispanic? Do the Words Make a Difference and Why?**
Friday Aug 17   10:00 AM to 11:00 AM
San Jose Convention Center - 210B

Moderator Diane Osborne, Chris Castro, Patty Garcia, Isabel Schechter, David Bowles

Why is "Mexicanx" such an important term? Do "Latinx" and "Hispanic" mean the same thing? Is it useful to refer to people from two continents, an isthmus, and and several islands using these adjectives? Is a Tarahumara person from Mexico who speaks no Spanish and has no European ancestors “Hispanic”? Looking into the future, will there still be “Latinx” people in 100 years? 1000 years? Our experts will discuss these terms, and their relevance.

**Beyond the Border I: What Is Happening to SF on the Other Side?**
Friday Aug 17   03:00 PM to 04:00 PM
San Jose Convention Center - 210A

Moderator David Bowles, Marcela Davison Avilés, Frederick Aldama, Mario Acevedo, Manuel Gonzales

At the Golden Globes when asked how he balanced darkness and joy, Guillermo del Toro answered "Because I'm Mexican". What does "being Mexican" mean within the context of science fiction? What does writing in Spanish mean for its future? There's movement on the other side of the border, a one-sided conversation where English-language SF is happening. We want to expand it and bring it forward. All over Latin America and Spain, SFi is rising again. We want to talk about what shapes it is taking, and how this viewpoint may be changing. Is there a Latino-futurism? What does it look like?

**Getting Into Comics: Why You Should, and How You Can**
Saturday Aug 18   10:00 AM to 11:00 AM
San Jose Convention Center - 210G

Moderator Leslie Light, Adam Gallardo, Ursula Vernon, Frederick Aldama

To many people, "comics" means people in brightly-colored costumes fighting each other in cheaply-printed pamphlets of paper. That isn't so true in 2018. In a world of webcomics, indie comics, self-published comics, and of graphic storytelling that includes every genre from romance to steampunk (and yes, you can still find super-hero stories), where can you start? What's the good stuff, and how can I find what I might like?

**Transgressing Borders**
Saturday Aug 18   12:00 PM to 01:00 PM
San Jose Convention Center - 210C

Moderator David Bowles, Gerardo Horacio Porcayo, Rose Lemberg

As political battles are fought over porous borders between nations, genders, races, and ethnicities, speculative fiction has begun to foster stories and voices that slip back and forth across those artificial divides or exist in what philosopher Gloria Anzaldúa termed nepantla—a liminal in-between space where new identities are forged and thrived. Panelists will discuss authors, illustrators, and works that exist in and explore these vibrant borderlands.


**Beyond The Border II: Borders, Crossings, and The Lands Beyond**
Saturday Aug 18   02:00 PM to 03:00 PM
San Jose Convention Center - 210B

Moderator and Translator Sue Burke, Gabriela Damián Miravete, Gerardo Horacio Porcayo, José Luis Zárate, Andrea Chapela  

Some of the first SF books were written in Spanish. Some of the most prominent speculative films of the last few decades have a Mexican as a director. Speculative fiction has taken many shapes in Spanish throughout history and now we want to talk beyond the past and the present and into the future. We want think about the ways SF written in Spanish might be evolving and the routes it is taking. What have the borders done? What are the similarities and differences with English and between Spanish countries? Have geography and language created something different on the other side? Where do we imagine it may be going?

Panelists will discuss in Spanish with an English translator for non-Spanish-speaking audience members.

**The Future of Middle-Grade SF/F in America**
Saturday Aug 18   02:00 PM to 03:00 PM

**Petrified Trees, Enchanted Mirrors: The Gothic Universe of Female Mexican Horror Writers**
Saturday Aug 18   03:00 PM to 04:00 PM
San Jose Convention Center - 212D

Moderator Andrea Chapela, Pepe Rojo, Raquel Castro, Gabriela Damián Miravete

Even though there is apparently neither a market or visible outlet for Mexican female horror writers, there is a hidden tradition of writers who have used the devices of the horror genre to explore issues of sexuality and the human and social condition. We see these women writers mining both the supernatural and technological forces that shape life in Mexico. This panel is an attempt to start mapping out this tradition from its early roots through the present.

**The Artist/Author: A New Wave of Storytellers**
Saturday Aug 18   03:00 PM to 04:00 PM
San Jose Convention Center - 210B

Moderator John Picacio, Gregory Manchess, Grace P. Fong, Robbie Treviño, Mariana Palova,

The panelists discuss how they are evolving their personal art visions into books, merchandise and story works, and why this wave is rising in popularity.

**The Body and The Shadow of the Imagination**
Saturday Aug 18   04:00 PM to 05:00 PM
San Jose Convention Center - 211C

Moderator Iliana Vargas, Felecia Caton Garcia, Libia Brenda, Laura Anne Gilman

How necessary is the visual or descriptive charge of an image in science fiction? How much do you have to let the viewer see and when do you suggest so that the reader's imaginative engine works by itself? How do we open dialogues with the reader or viewer so that they activate their own channels of imaginative communication?

**Fantasy Canon From the Margins**
Saturday Aug 18   05:00 PM to 06:00 PM
San Jose Convention Center - 210C

Moderator Alberto Chimal, Mario Acevedo, Marc Johnson, SL Huang, Libia Brenda, Suzanne Walker

Fantasy stories sometimes inadvertently echo harmful stereotypes about race, religion, sexuality, or disability. Even beloved classics may raise difficult issues from the perspective of POC, queer, religious minority, or disabled readers. What are readers to do when they see themselves marginalized in stories they care about? How can we reclaim the role of the outsider? And how can we use these works to inform productive discussion of the speculative fiction canon and its future direction?

Sunday Aug 19   12:00 PM to 01:00 PM
San Jose Convention Center - 210G

Moderator Kelly Robson, Rebecca Roanhorse, Mario Acevedo, Marc Johnson, Aaron Duran, Gideon Marcus

In the past, dystopian fiction has served as a kind of modern-day cautionary fable. But what's the other side of the coin? How do we tell tales of futures that we can aspire to, rather than ones that we warn against? What are we working towards, and how do we avoid the pitfalls of premature nostalgia and the tendency to excessively homogenize our utopias?

**Coco (Film Screening)**

San Jose Convention Center - LL21AB

Aspiring musician Miguel, confronted with his family's ancestral ban on music, enters the Land of the Dead to find his great-great-grandfather, a legendary singer.

**The Lost Warriors**
Sunday Aug 19   01:00 PM to 02:00 PM
San Jose Convention Center - 210E

Moderator Fonda Lee, Gonzalo Alvarez, Gerardo Horacio Porcayo, Wesley Chu

In the last few years, representation of marginalized cultures in pop culture, comics and video games has been growing, but it is still not enough. We've seen medieval knights thousands of times, but what about the feathered warriors of Mexico or other cultures around the world? We need all kinds of warriors in our media, and to continue to fight for their space, we should look at what projects are presenting these new warriors. What are our favorite "examples"? How can we inspire others? Where are these new warriors and how can we make sure they sit at the table and stay.

San Jose Convention Center - 210F

Moderator Foz Meadows, Aaron Duran, David Bowles, Ursula Vernon, Gonzalo Alvarez, Henry Jenkins, Der-shing Helmer

Webcomics are arguably a different sequential art form, with different ways of reading, and different topics and themes. And they're really popular. The panel recommends some of their favorite webcomics, as well as watering holes, so to speak, where you can browse through webcomics on your own while you're on your morning commute. Check it out!
