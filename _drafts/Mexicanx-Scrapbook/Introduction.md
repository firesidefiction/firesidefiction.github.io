**Introduction to the Mexicanx Initiative Scrapbook**

This is a collection of memories, a spontaneous burst of creative works, a celebration of Mexicanx creators and fans, and a documentation of something that started with passion and a vision and grew into so much more.

The Mexicanx Initiative, started by Worldcon 76 Artist Guest of Honor, John Picacio, and sponsored by many wonderful and caring members of the Worldcon community, brought 42 Mexican and Mexican-American people to San Jose California in August of 2018 to attend Worldcon 76.

Stories, essays, food, poems, art, and so much more were born of this experience. From Lauren Raye Snow's incredibly powerful Mexicanx Initiative Manifesto to Héctor González's array of delicious (and cleverly named!) salsas to the anthology A Larger Reality: Speculative Fiction from the Bicultural Margins, the Initiative made community and creativity blossom. But more than that, it gave the participants a sense of belonging, both with each other, and within the larger community of science fiction fandom.

The word that Initiative members most often use to describe the Initiative now is familia. We hope that as you explore this scrapbook you'll feel like part of the family, too.
