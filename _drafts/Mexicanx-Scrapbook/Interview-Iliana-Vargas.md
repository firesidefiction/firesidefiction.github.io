**Where did you grow up and where do you live now? Where can we find you on social media?**

I was born in Mexico City. I lived for eight months in Ecuador, but I returned to Mexico in 2013 and I have lived here since then. I have a personal website: [www.alteracionesdelpsicosoma.wordpress.com](www.alteracionesdelpsicosoma.wordpress.com)

**What kind of creative work do you do?**

I dedicate myself to the narrative of the fantastic imagination, above all, writing short stories and literary essays.

**Had you ever been to a Worldcon before?**

No. Worldcon 76 was my first time, and it was amazing.

**What did you expect being part of the Initiative would be like? How did your experience compare with that expectation?**

I was very excited to meet more people who worked in Science Fiction, but I did not expect to discover so many points in common even though everyone focused on different creative languages.

**Tell us about one highlight moment of your Worldcon experience.**

I think the chance to share my work with an audience whose native language was not Spanish was very exciting for me because I had never had the opportunity to do that before.

**Recommend any or all of the following: a song, a written work, a piece of visual art, and a movie. Tell us why you love them!**

One of my friends has been working on virtual reality and animated reality, with an integrated sound element. His name is Julian Bonequi and I love his particular vision of dreams and imaginative realities. You can find him at [https://www.julianbonequi.com/cg/](https://www.julianbonequi.com/cg/)

**What was the funniest thing that happened during your trip?**

When a policeman tried to help me buy a card for the trolley car and the machine swallowed the money.

**Where should new people start familiarizing themselves with your work?**

I have a monthly column in _Vozed_ magazine, and the links to my stories in digital publications are at [www.alteracionesdelpsicosoma/huellavirtual.wordpress.com](http://www.alteracionesdelpsicosoma/huellavirtual.wordpress.com). Also, my first story translated into English is in the Mexicanx Initiative anthology: _A larger realityâ€¦_
