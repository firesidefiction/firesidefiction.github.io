**Interview with Gerardo Horacio Porcayo**

**Where did you grow up and where do you live now?
Where can we find you on social media?**

I was born in Cuernavaca, Mexico, but grew up in Jojutla, which is a small city two hours south of Mexico City, and where I currently live since 2015, after living for 28 years in Puebla.

**What kind of creative work do you do?**

I'm a writer, mostly a novelist, but everything related to narrative
is not unfamiliar to me.

**Had you ever been to a Worldcon before?**

Never, Worldcon 76 was my first one.

**What did you expect being part of the Initiative would be like? How
did your experience compare with that expectation?**

In the beginning, nothing. For me it was just like an external source of help to fulfill a dream, but when I reached San Jose and met everyone, I switched to this family view. So everything was a win.

**Tell us about one highlight moment of your Worldcon experience.**

The Hugo Awards Ceremony, without a doubt, and the Losers Party afterwards.

**Recommend any or all of the following: a song, a written work, a
piece of visual art, and a movie. Tell us why you love them!**

"Fascination Street" by The Cure, because of the urban loneliness that you can almost touch when you listen to it.

*Riders of the Purple Wage* by Philip Jose Farmer, because it's a tour de force of stylish SF.

"Las tentaciones de San Antonio" by Salvador Dal√≠, because I love surrealism, and I love his insect elephants.

*The City of Lost Children* by Jean Pierre Jeunet, because it's a poetic film with a mad scientist, cyberpunk, steampunk and weird alliances.

**What was the funniest thing that happened during your trip?**

Nothing, I'm dead serious, ha ha ha =)

**Where should new people start familiarizing
themselves with your work?**

My short story "The Other Con" is in both English and Spanish in this scrapbook.

My most famous novel hasn't been translated but it's called *La Primera Calle de la Soledad*.

And you can download (for free, but only in Spanish) my noir-fantasy novel *El cuerpo del delirio* at: [http://ri.uaemex.mx/handle/123456789/21702](http://ri.uaemex.mx/handle/123456789/21702)
