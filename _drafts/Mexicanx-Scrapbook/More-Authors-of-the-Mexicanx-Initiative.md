**More Authors of the Mexicanx Initiative**

Several of the Initiative's authors didn't have time to contribute to the anthology, but they joined in programming items like readings and panels, and one of them even felt inspired by Worldcon 76 to write a short story after the con!

In this section, you'll find Gerardo Horacio Porcayo's Worldcon 76 inspired fiction (in both English and Spanish!), and several experiences, including a run in with a stormtrooper!
