I am an artist and a con runner. I work in resin and 3D art and make jewelry. I have designed two Hugo bases and the Young Adult Award this year for the ceremony. For convention work I usually do something creative as well, design, marketing, promotions side of things.

**Had you ever been to a Worldcon before?**

Yes, my first Worldcon was Chicon in 2000. I have been going off and on since then. I have been to the last 6 Worldcons in the US.

**What was your experience like as part of the Mexicanx Initiative?**

I wish I had more time to spend with the people in the initiative! Seeing all the excitement and wishing that my first Worldcon experience had included something like the amazing group of people that were involved.

**Tell us about one highlight moment of your WorldCon experience.**

My favorite moment was when Sheila Gilbert mentioned me and Vincent Villafranca in her Hugo acceptance speech for creating the Hugo base this year and in 2016. I am always so excited to see people wearing my jewelry I make, but this took it to a whole new exciting level for me.

**Recommend any or all of the following: a song, a written work, a piece of visual art, and a movie. Tell us why you love them!**

The latest book I was blown away by was something I backed on Kickstarter and recently received in the mail. [_Faeries of the Faultlines_ By Iris Compiet.](https://www.faeriesofthefaultlines.com) My first fantasy art book was _Faeries_ by Brian Froud and Alan Lee. This book has brought back all the wonder and excitement I felt when I used to pour over the _Faeries_ book years ago. Her drawings and sketches really feel like it is part of the world I glimpsed as a child. The fonts, the colors, the feel of the pages are all very reminiscent of world that Froud and Lee brought to life.

**What was the funniest thing that happened during your trip?**

Falling asleep during a party being thrown in my hotel room?  It was an exhausting trip and well worth it!

**Where should new people start familiarizing themselves with your work?**

I mostly post on facebook on my account, but also deviantart I try and keep up to date as well.  [www.deviantart.com/sillysarasue](http://www.deviantart.com/sillysarasue)
