Cupping the stories in my palms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_They will not be lost_
Carrying the stories in my hands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_They will not be stopped_
Cradling the stories in my arms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_They will not be forgotten_
Crushing the stories into my skin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_They will not be forsaken_

We will keep the stories alive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_as they have kept us_

The words are embedded in my muscles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Here they are sheltered_
The words are embossed on my veins
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Here they are treasured_
The words are engraved in my ventricles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Here they are nourished_
The words are incised in my brain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_And soon will flourish again_
