Oh, look! Fireside has a damned style guide!

*General*

No fucking sans serif fonts. All serif, all the time.

No background images, only headers.

*Social Media*

Antifa rhetoric and punching nazis is encouraged.

Moderate swearing is also encouraged.

We continue to perpetually assume that Brian is both himself and the Fireside twitter man behind the curtain.

Kit kats can only be eaten the wrong way.

Elsa's handle is @snarkbat not @elsabat, you poor bastards.

Elsa is the keeper of Brian's captivity.

*Stories*

Author names are not bolded.

Two spaces between paragraphs.

No more than 2 sentences for excerpts in short stories, one sentence for flash.

Make sure to add captions to images, we have low vision readers!
