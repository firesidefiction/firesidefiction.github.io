# Guidelines

We welcome previously unpublished work ('published' includes work posted on Patreon or on a blog) in English or Spanish from all writers anywhere in the world, and we are interested in seeing work from people of color, LGBTQIA people, disabled people, members of religious minorities, and people outside the United States. We strongly encourage submissions from people of those backgrounds, and all others whom traditional publishing has historically excluded.

If you have any questions about how to submit, please email us at: [questions@firesidefiction.com](mailto:questions@firesidefiction.com). (_Any submissions sent via email will be deleted unread._)

## Accessibility
We use an online form to gather submissions, but we understand that this may not be universally accessible to disabled people. If you have questions related to accessibility, please email us at [questions@firesidefiction.com](mailto:questions@firesidefiction.com?subject:Accessibility Query) with the subject line: Accessibility Query. Accessibility Queries should only contain a request to submit by alternate means, and should not include a submission.

_Any submissions sent via email will be deleted unread._

## Short Stories

We accept short stories up to 3,000 words. Our budget allows us to pay for up to 7,000 words per month, which means we are always going to buy more shorter fiction than longer stories.

Please read the following guidelines. During open submissions periods, there will be a form below for uploading your submission.

### Please submit:
- Stories in English or Spanish
- Stories that have never been published before.
- Short stories up to 3,000 words.
- Stories of any genre.
- Submissions from anywhere in the world, from all kinds of voices.
- One Docx file set in a comfortably-sized, legible font.
- Cover letters are optional, but they are great places to tell us about your connection to the material, personal background or identity, and to include content warnings if your story deals with difficult subject matter.
- Only one story per author — no multiple submissions. (But it is fine to resubmit a story you've submitted previously to us for another issue.)
- Sending your story to other venues (simultaneous submissions) is okay, but we ask that you please withdraw immediately if you take another offer by emailing [editorial@firesidefiction.com](mailto:editorial@firesidefiction.com).

### Please don’t send us:
- Stories that promote fascism, racism, sexism, homophobia, ableism, etc.
- Stories longer than 3,000 words (please don't email to ask if you're the special exception — you're not).
- PDF files
- Submissions via email. Emailed submissions will be deleted unread. Please use the submissions form.
- Stories that use intellectual property that is under copyright (we enjoy fanfic, but we don't publish it).

### What to expect from us:
- Fireside acquires English language rights in print, digital, and audio formats. Please see our [Story Contract Boilerplate](https://firesidefiction.com/legal/story-contract-boilerplate) for the full text of our contract.
- First responses (either a rejection or a second round notice) within approximately 30 days from the end of our reading period, and a final decision by the end of May, 2021. If there’s any delay to this timing, we’ll let you know.
- Payment of 12.5 cents per word

## Artwork
Fireside commissions original artwork for specific stories. If you send us a link to your portfolio using [this form](https://airtable.com/shrHIocwQiPakQgkT), we will be happy to add it to our roster, and if a story comes up for which we think you’d be a good fit, we’ll be in touch.

### What to expect from us:
- Fireside acquires worldwide rights in print and digital formats, and ownership of all original art remains with the Artist. Please see our [Illustration Contract Boilerplate](https://firesidefiction.com/legal/illustration-contract-boilerplate) for the full text of our contract.
