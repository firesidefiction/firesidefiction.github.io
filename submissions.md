Fireside Magazine will stop publishing [later this year](http://firesidefiction.com/fireside-will-stop-publishing-later-this-year), and we are no longer accepting submissions.

All previous submissions have been sent final responses. If you should have received a response but did not, feel free to inquire by emailing us at questions@firesidefiction.com so we can look into it.
