Fireside is currently open to submissions. Please read the following guidelines, then use the form below to submit your work. <!--During our submissions periods, there will be a form for uploading your submission on this page.-->

Fireside holds a submissions period for each upcoming issue of _Fireside Quarterly_. We will be open to submissions for short stories during the following periods:

- **NOW OPEN:** Submissions for the Summer 2020 issue of _Fireside Quarterly_, edited by Kate Dollarhyde, open from **August 26, 2019 at 9am EST** to **August 30, 2019 at 6pm EST**

- Submissions for the Autumn 2020 issue of _Fireside Quarterly_, edited by Maurice Broaddus, will be open from **December 2, 2019 at 9am EST** to **December 6, 2019 at 6pm EST**

We welcome previously unpublished work ('published' includes work posted on Patreon or on a blog) in English or Spanish from all writers, and we are especially interested in seeing work from people of color, LGBTQIA people, disabled people, members of religious minorities, and people outside the United States. We strongly encourage submissions from people of those backgrounds, and all others whom traditional publishing has historically excluded.

Below you will find our submissions guidelines for:
- [Short Stories](#short-stories)
- [Poetry](#poetry)
- [Non-Fiction](#non-fiction)
- [Novels and Novellas](#novels-and-novellas)
- [Artwork](#artwork)

If you have any questions about how to submit please email us at: [questions@firesidefiction.com](mailto:questions@firesidefiction.com).

### Accessibility
We use an online form to gather submissions, but we understand that this may not be universally accessible to disabled people. If you have questions related to accessibility, please email us at [questions@firesidefiction.com with the subject line: Accessibility Query](mailto:questions@firesidefiction.com?subject:Accessibility Query). Accessibility Queries should only contain a request to submit by alternate means, and not be a submission.

Any submissions sent via email will be deleted unread.

## Short Stories

We accept short stories up to 3,000 words. Our budget allows us to pay for up to 7,000 words per month, which means we are always going to buy more shorter fiction than longer stories. We especially love to see very short pieces that still tell great stories and make us laugh, cry, or transport us to new worlds. We love short short stories, like Karl Dandenell's '[We Who Stay Behind](https://firesidefiction.com/we-who-stay-behind);' '[Junebug's Magical Magnificent Mercurial Barbershop](https://firesidefiction.com/junebugs-magical-magnificent-mercurial-barbershop)' by Malon Edwards, and of course, '[Parasitismo](https://firesidefiction.com/parasitismo),' by Alberto Chimal (¡sí, aquí también se habla español!).

Please read the following guidelines, then use the form below to submit your work.

### Please submit:
- Stories in English or Spanish

- Short stories up to 3,000 words.
- Stories of any genre with a strong beginning/middle/end plot arc.
- Submissions from anywhere in the world, from all kinds of voices.
- Double spaced Docx or RTF files set in a 14 point serif font like Times New Roman.
- Cover letters are optional, but they are great places to tell us about your connection the material, personal background or identity, and to include content warnings if your story deals with difficult subject matter.

### Please don’t send us:
