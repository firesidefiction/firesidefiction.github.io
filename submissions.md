We welcome previously unpublished work ('published' includes work posted on Patreon or on a blog) in English or Spanish from all writers, and we are especially interested in seeing work from people of color, LGBTQIA+ people, disabled people, members of religious minorities, and people outside the United States. We strongly encourage submissions from people of those backgrounds, and all others whom traditional publishing has historically excluded.

Below you will find our submissions dates and guidelines for:
- [Short Stories](#short-stories)
- [Poetry](#poetry)
- [Non-Fiction](#non-fiction)
- [Novels and Novellas](#novels-and-novellas)
- [Artwork](#artwork)

If you have any questions about how to submit please email us at: [questions@firesidefiction.com](mailto:questions@firesidefiction.com).

### Accessibility
We use a simple form to gather submissions, but we understand that this is not universally accessible to disabled people. If you have questions related to accessibility, please email us at [questions@firesidefiction.com](mailto:questions@firesidefiction.com) with the subject line: 'Accessibility Query.' Accessibility Queries should only contain a request to submit by alternate means, and not be a submission.

Any submissions sent via email will be deleted unread.

We especially love to see very short pieces that still tell great stories and make us laugh, cry, or transport us to new worlds. We love short short stories, like Karl Dandenell's '[We Who Stay Behind](https://firesidefiction.com/we-who-stay-behind);' '[Junebug's Magical Magnificent Mercurial Barbershop](https://firesidefiction.com/junebugs-magical-magnificent-mercurial-barbershop)' by Malon Edwards, and of course, '[Parasitismo](https://firesidefiction.com/parasitismo),' by Alberto Chimal (¡sí, aquí también se habla español!).
