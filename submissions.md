---

We welcome previously unpublished (including on Patreon or a blog) work from all writers, and we are especially interested in seeing work from people of color, LGBTQIA+ people, disabled people, members of religious minorities, and people outside the United States. We strongly encourage submissions from people of those backgrounds, and all others whom traditional publishing has historically excluded, and we believe that any story you want to tell is a valid story, regardless of whether it centers issues related to being part of a marginalized group.

Below you will find our submissions dates and guidelines for:
- [Short Stories](#short-stories)
- [Poetry](#poetry)
- [Non-Fiction](#non-fiction)
- [Novels and Novellas](#novels-and-novellas)
- [Artwork](#artwork)

If you have any questions about how to submit please email us at: [editorial@firesidefiction.com](mailto:editorial@firesidefiction.com). We use Submittable to manage our reading periods, but we understand that this is not universally accessible to disabled people. If you have questions related to accesibility, please email us at [editorial@firesidefiction.com](mailto:editorial@firesidefiction.com) with the subject line: Accessibility Query. Accessibility Queries should only contain a request to submit by alternate means, and not be a submission.

## Short Stories

{% include submissions-closed-button.html %}

Fireside is currently closed to short story submissions. Our next short story reading period will be from the 15th to the 31st of December, 2018. During that period, there will be a link to our submissions form here.

We accept short stories up to 4,000 words. Our budget allows us to pay for up to 7,000 words per month, which means we are always going to buy more shorter fiction than longer stories. We especially love to see very short pieces that still tell great stories and make us laugh, cry, or transport us to new worlds.

### Please submit:
- Stories that have never been published in the English language before (translations are okay!).
- Short stories up to 4,000 words.
- Stories of any genre with a strong beginning/middle/end plot arc.
- Submissions from anywhere in the world, from all kinds of voices.
- Double spaced Doc, Docx, or RTF files set in a 14 point serif font like Times New Roman (please don’t use Courier—we are asking this for accessibility reasons since our managing editor is blind).
- Cover letters are optional, but they are great places to tell us about your connection the material, personal background or identity, and to include content warnings if your story deals with difficult subject matter.

### Please don’t send us:
- Stories that promote fascism, racism, sexism, homophobia, ableism, etc.
- Stories longer than 4,000 words (we cannot consider these, unfortunately).
- PDF files or submissions pasted into the body of an email.
- Stories that use intellectual property that is under copyright (we don’t want to get sued).
- Stories that are currently being considered elsewhere (no simultaneous submissions).

### What to expect from us:
- Fireside acquires first-world English-language rights in print, digital, and audio formats, with a six-month exclusivity window after publication. Please see our [Story Contract Boilerplate](https://firesidefiction.com/legal/story-contract-boilerplate) for the full text of our contract.
- First responses (either a rejection or a second round notice) within one month of the end of our reading period.
- 12.5 cents per word in payment for accepted stories.
- Worldwide payments via the method the author and publisher agree upon.

### Please Submit:

- Up to three poems at a time, all in one document. We do not accept multiple document submissions.

- Doc, Docx, or RTF files. Poetry can be formatted in whatever way feels best to you. We don’t require double spacing for this kind of submission. For poetry only, PDF files are also acceptable.
- Poems that have never been published in the English language before (translations are okay!).

### Please don’t send us:
- Poems that promote fascism, racism, sexism, homophobia, ableism, etc.
- Poems pasted into the body of an email.

## Non-Fiction
Fireside is committed to publishing non-fiction which reflects our values and engages with the conversations we want to have with the world. Currently all of our non-fiction is by solicitation only.

## Novels and Novellas

{% include submissions-closed-button.html %}

Fireside is currently closed to submissions for novels and novellas. We don't have upcoming dates to announce just yet, but when we open again, there will be a link to our submissions form here.

### Please submit:
- Your completed novel or novella (20,000-120,000 words). We are open to any genre as long as the story transports us.
- Work that has never been published in the English language before (translations are okay!)
- A query letter with the title, genre, length, a short pitch of the concept, and a short bio.
- A synopsis, up to 2,000 words (but shorter is definitely okay!) consisting of a detailed outline of your story, including any major plot twists and the ending.
- Simultaneous submissions are okay for novels and novellas, but we ask that you please withdraw immediately if you take another offer.

### Please don’t send us:
- Stories that promote fascism, racism, sexism, homophobia, ableism, etc.
- Novels longer than 120,000 words (please query if you feel you have a longer work that we might want to consider).
- PDF files or submissions pasted into the body of an email.
- Stories that use intellectual property that is under copyright (we don’t want to get sued).

### What to expect from us:
- While we don’t pay advances, Fireside offers royalties on sales of all books, so our authors start seeing money from their work as soon as it’s published. We negotiate rights purchased and compensation on a case by case basis, so we don’t have one standard boilerplate novel and novella contract, but we are committed to treating creators fairly.
- Responses within 2 months of the end of our submissions period.

### What to expect from us:
- Fireside acquires worldwide rights in print and digital formats, and ownership of all original art remains with the Artist. Please see our [Illustration Contract Boilerplate](https://firesidefiction.com/legal/illustration-contract-boilerplate) for the full text of our contract.
