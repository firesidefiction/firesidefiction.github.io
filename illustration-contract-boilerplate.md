## Description

## Schedule

### Project Milestones

_The delivery of the final files by the Artist is contingent upon payment of fee in full by Fireside._

### Pause Clause
If a deliverable from Fireside—such as feedback, approvals, or payment—is late more than 3 business days, the project will be considered “on hold.” That means that all work stops. Once the deliverable in question is received, the project is re-activated, but it will be rescheduled based on the Artist's current workload and availability. Just to say it loud and clear, it could be weeks to get Fireside back in the Artist's schedule if the project is put on hold.

### Acceptance:
The Illustration will be considered accepted after revisions have been approved by the Artist and by Fireside.

### Exclusivity:
The Artist agrees not to publish or permit others to publish the Illustration in any form prior to the Illustration’s publication in Fireside Magazine and for a period of six (6) months after the Illustration's publication in Fireside Magazine, unless the Artist obtains Fireside’s prior written approval.

### Exclusivity Exception:
The Artist reserves the right to publish the Illustration at any time after publication, on their own website, or in any other venue for self-promotional use, as part of their portfolio of work, or to enter the artwork into 'best of' anthologies or competitions.

## Payment
In consideration for the rights granted by the Artist to Fireside, and the Artist’s performance of obligations under this Agreement, the Artist will receive a payment in the sum of **USD $400.00**, which will be paid immediately upon acceptance of the Illustration.

Fireside's right to use the Illustration is conditioned upon receipt of payment, and upon Fireside’s compliance with the terms of this agreement.

Payment will be made via the Artist's preferred payment method, within reason. Fireside is not responsible for fees associated with an Artist's preferred payment method, such as bank transfer fees or PayPal fees.
