## Terms

**Reservation of rights:** All rights not expressly granted in this agreement are retained by the Author, including, but not limited to, all rights to drafts or other preliminary materials. Any use additional to that expressly granted above requires arrangement for payment of a separate fee.

**Infringement:** If the copyright in the Poem is infringed, and if the parties proceed jointly, the expenses and recoveries, if any, shall be shared equally, and if they do not proceed jointly, either party shall have the right to prosecute such action, and such party shall bear the expenses thereof, and any recoveries after the deduction of such expenses shall be divided between them.

**Revisions:** Fireside reserves the right to ask the Author to make revisions to the Poem. The Author may refuse to make revisions and withdraw the Poem from Fireside Magazine. If the Author does not acknowledge a request for revisions within seven (7) days, the Poem will be considered withdrawn.

**Original Work:** The Author represents and warrants that they are the sole author of the Poem; that they are the owner of all the rights granted to Fireside hereunder and have full power to enter into this agreement and to make the grants herein contained; that the Poem is original and any prior publication of the Poem in whole or in part has been fully disclosed to Fireside; that the Poem does not violate the right of privacy of any person; that, to the best of the Author’s knowledge, it is not libelous and contains no matter which is libelous, in violation of any right of privacy, harmful to any third party so as to subject Fireside to liability or cause Fireside to engage in conduct that would be contrary to law; that it does not infringe upon any copyright, trademark, or upon any other proprietary or personal right of any person, firm, or corporation, and that the Author is unaware of any such pending claims. The Author agrees to promptly notify Fireside should a claim for any of the aforementioned be made against the Author.

**Indemnification:** The Author will indemnify Fireside against any loss, injury, or damage finally sustained (including any legal costs, attorney’s fees, and expenses paid by Fireside) occasioned to Fireside in connection with or in consequence or any breach of this representation and warranty. If Author shall breach this warranty, Fireside shall be entitled to injunctive relief in addition to all other remedies, which may be available to it.

The Author will be credited on any table of contents pages and at the beginning of the Poem as [Author's Preferred Pen Name].

**Severability:** If any term of this Agreement is to any extent illegal, otherwise invalid, or incapable of being enforced, such term shall be excluded to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability; all other terms hereof shall remain in full force and in effect; and, to the extent permitted and possible, the invalid or unenforceable term shall be deemed replaced by a term that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of such invalid or unenforceable term.

**Dispute Resolution:** If a dispute arises out of or relates to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, and if the dispute cannot be settled through negotiation, the parties agree first to try in good faith to settle the dispute by mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association before resorting to arbitration or litigation. The jurisdiction for arbitration or litigation shall be New York.

## The Dotted Line
