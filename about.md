## What is Fireside?
Fireside Fiction Company started in 2012 as a Kickstarter-funded short-story magazine. We began with the goals of finding and publishing great stories regardless of genre, and paying our writers well. Since Nov. 8, 2016, we have a third goal: resisting the global rise of fascism and far-right populism, starting with the current occupant of the White House.

For general inquiries, please contact [questions@firesidefiction.com](mailto:questions@firesidefiction.com). For press requests, please email [marketing@firesidefiction.com](mailto:marketing@firesidefiction.com).

## Fair pay for everyone
Fair pay is a big deal for us. We think creative people should be able to make a living from their work. This is one of our [core values](../values.html).

Fireside pays USD 12.5 cents per word, well above the 8 cents currently considered to be the minimum professional rate. In fact, we pay better than almost every other [<abbr title="Sif Wah">SFWA</abbr>-qualifying market](http://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#short). For illustrations, we pay $400 for a full-color piece.

## Fireside is brought to you by:

### Pablo Defendini — Publisher & Art Director
Pablo Defendini is [a designer and developer for hire](http://defendini.com), with a focus on editorial design for digital media. He helped launch [Tor.com](http://tor.com/), before moving on to work for companies that sit in the overlap between publishing and technology, like [Open Road Media](http://openroadmedia.com/) and [O'Reilly](https://safaribooksonline.com/). Pablo was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico, lives in New York City, and works with people all over the world.

### Brian White — Founding Editor
Brian started Fireside in 2012 with a Kickstarter and a whole lot of love. Over the next five years as editor and publisher – with the help of his amazing team and of Lauren, his wife and partner in crime – he expanded Fireside from a one-off magazine to a monthly publication to its current form, a site with weekly fiction and occasional nonfiction. Fireside published 150 stories under his tenure, as well as five novels and one novella. He is deeply proud to have had a part in bringing those stories into the world. He was gratified to have proved that writers can be paid more for their work than the industry accepted, and perhaps most proud of the [\#BlackSpecFic](https://medium.com/fireside-fiction-company/antiblack-racism-in-speculative-fiction-7e30eff97008) report that Fireside published in 2016. He stepped down as editor and publisher in the [summer of 2017](/teach-me-how-to-say-goodbye), but he remains an equity partner in the company.

## Editors

### Julia Rios — Editor
Julia Rios is a writer, editor, podcaster, and narrator. Her fiction, non-fiction, and poetry have appeared in several places, including _Daily Science Fiction_, _Apex Magazine_, and _Goblin Fruit_. In addition to being a senior fiction editor for _Strange Horizons_ from 2012 to 2015, she has edited poetry and reprints for _Uncanny Magazine_ and co-edited several anthologies with Alisa Krasnostein, including _Kaleidoscope: Diverse YA Science Fiction and Fantasy Stories_, and the Year's Best YA Speculative Fiction series. She is a co-host of the Hugo-nominated podcast, The Skiffy and Fanty Show, a general discussion, interview, and movie review show, and [Walkthrough](https://walkthroughpodcast.com/), a discussion of exercise and geekery with Amal El-Mohtar and Layla Al-Bedawi. She has narrated stories for _Podcastle_, _Pseudopod_, and _Cast of Wonders_, and poems for the _Strange Horizons_ podcast. As one of the four co-founders of [Fuente Collective](http://www.fuenteco.com/), she is interested in encouraging creativity and community across multiple genres, cultures, and disciplines.

### Chelle Parker — Copyeditor
Chelle Parker is a queer, non-binary, neuroatypical, disabled mega-nerd and has enjoyed an unusually colourful life, having lived in or visited fourteen countries on four continents and learned seven languages along the way. Chelle's background is primarily in education, where she spent eight years teaching English, French, math, science, and life skills to at-risk junior-high students, but she's also worked in a peculiar array of other environments. These range from daycares to sexual health clinics, doing jobs as diverse as librarian, baker, radio DJ, and Braille transcriptionist, all while editing on the side.

These days, Chelle is staying put (more or less) in her hometown of Ottawa, Canada, where she wields her trusty red pen as a freelance [editor-for-hire](https://www.mparkerediting.com) and acts as a human shield for her chronically-anxious rescue dog. Some of her regular gigs include copyediting everything for _Fireside Magazine/Fireside Quarterly_, translating and editing graphic novels for Europe Comics, and reviewing speculative fiction and erotica for _Publishers Weekly_. She is also a member of multiple professional organizations, including Editors Canada, the Editorial Freelancers Association, the American Copy Editors Society, and the Association of Independent Publishing Professionals.

If you're ever in Ottawa and notice someone's taken a handful of colourful Sharpies to ugly comments on the inside of all the public bathroom stalls, there's a good chance that someone was her.

## Content Notes
Fireside provides content notes for books and stories to guide readers who may wish to seek out or avoid particular story elements. These content notes may contain spoilers.

Content notes are not the same as the ratings found on movies, TV shows, and video games. The intent is to help trauma survivors avoid being surprised by story elements that may trigger pain or emotional distress. So we don’t offer warnings about general violence, profanity, sex, or other things one sees in a movie rating.

We welcome suggestions for elements to include or exclude. You can email us at [editorial@firesidefiction.com](mailto:editorial@firesidefiction.com). (Please do _not_ send submissions here. Any stories sent to this address will be deleted unread.)

Here is a list of some of the elements we currently offer notes for:

- Alcohol Abuse
- Animal Abuse
- Child Abuse
- Child Death
- Domestic Violence
- Drug Abuse
- Emotional Abuse
- Gender-Bias Violence
- LGBTQ-Bias Violence
- Racial/Ethnic-Bias Violence
- Self-Harm
- Sexual Assault
- Suicide
- Torture
