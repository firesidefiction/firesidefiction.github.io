## What is Fireside?

Fireside Fiction Company started in 2012 with a Kickstarter-funded short-story magazine. We began with the goals of finding and publishing great stories regardless of genre, and paying our writers well. Fireside grew to have two branches for doing so: _Fireside Magazine_ and Fireside Books. 
After a 10-year run, [Fireside will stop publishing later this year.](http://firesidefiction.com/fireside-will-stop-publishing-later-this-year)

## Fair pay for everyone
Fair pay is a big deal for us. We think creative people should be able to make a living from their work. This is one of our [core values](../values.html).

_Fireside Magazine_ pays USD 12.5 cents per word, well above the 8 cents currently considered to be the minimum professional rate. In fact, we pay better than almost every other [<abbr title="Sif Wah">SFWA</abbr>-qualifying market](http://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#short). For poems, we pay a flat USD $100; for illustrations, we pay USD $400 for a full-color piece.

## Fireside is brought to you by:

### Brian White — Executive Editor and Owner
Brian started Fireside Fiction Company in 2012 as an experiment in crowdfunding and paying speculative fiction writers well above the accepted professional rate at the time. It worked! Thanks, have a great day!

Brian has been informed he has to write more in his bio. Fine! Brian took that experiment through five Kickstarters (and did not die!) and into a subscription model. During his tenure, Fireside published 150 stories, five novels, and one novella, and also published the first [\#BlackSpecFic](https://medium.com/fireside-fiction-company/antiblack-racism-in-speculative-fiction-7e30eff97008) report, which examined the massive under-representation of Black short-story writers in the field, prompting conversation, reflection, and change in the speculative fiction community. It remains one of the most important things he has worked on in his adult life. Brian was a 2017 World Fantasy Award finalist in the Special Award, Non-Professional category for Fireside, and Fireside has been nominated for multiple Hugo Awards.

Facing the burnout that is all too common among people who work at small presses, Brian stepped down as editor and publisher in 2017 to regroup and recharge mentally. He returned as interim editorial director in 2020 and resumed full ownership of the company in June 2021 with a great team you can read about below.

In the wider world, Brian is a former journalist who worked as an editor at _The Courier-Journal_ in Louisville from 2006–2010 and at the _Boston Globe_ from 2010–2018, where he was part of the staff that won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting in 2014 for the newspaper's coverage of the Boston Marathon bombing in 2014. He still lives around Boston, where he works as an editor for a private company and takes photographs, paints miniatures, and spends time with his amazing wife and various cats.

### Chelle Parker — Managing Editor, Copyeditor, Proofreader
Chelle is a queer, nonbinary, neuroatypical, disabled nerd and has enjoyed an unusually colourful life, having lived in or visited fourteen countries on four continents and learned seven languages along the way. Chelle's background is primarily in education, where they spent eight years teaching English, French, math, science, and life skills to at-risk junior-high students, but they've also worked in a peculiar array of other environments. These range from daycares to sexual health clinics, doing jobs as diverse as librarian, baker, radio DJ, and Braille transcriptionist — all while editing on the side.

Chelle's staying put for the moment (more or less) in their hometown of Ottawa, Canada — on unceded Algonquin Anishnaabeg territory — where they wield their trusty red pen as a full-time freelance editor, act as the managing editor of Fireside Fiction Company's _Fireside Magazine_, and serve as a human shield for their chronically anxious rescue dog. Some of their more notable editing clients include animation giant Mediatoon's Europe Comics imprint (for whom they edit graphic novels translated from French into English), Fireside Fiction Company (for whom they also copyedit and proofread all the short stories, essays, and poems that are released through the magazine), and _Publishers Weekly_'s BookLife Reviews (for whom they have fact-checked and edited reviews). They also devote a significant portion of their time to their role as the Program Co-Chair for Readercon, a world-renowned speculative fiction conference; there, Chelle helps develop the program and select panelists, helps build and edit all participant bios, and also edits the annual Program Guide and Souvenir Book. They also volunteer as a grants juror for the Speculative Literature Foundation.

If you're ever in Ottawa and notice someone’s taken a handful of colourful Sharpies to ugly comments on the inside of all the public bathroom stalls, there’s a good chance that someone was them.

### L. D. Lewis — Publisher, Art Director, Web Wrangler
L.D. Lewis does... a lot.

She is an award-winning SF/F writer and editor. She serves as a founding creator, art director, and project manager for the World Fantasy Award-winning and Hugo Award-nominated FIYAH Literary Magazine. She also serves as the founding director of Hugo-nominated FIYAHCON, chair of the 2021 Nebula Conference, awards manager for the Lambda Literary Foundation, treasurer for Diverse Voice Inc., and grants administrator for the Speculative Literature Foundation. She acquires novellas for Tor.com and researches for the LeVar Burton Reads podcast. She frequently bothers the publishing industry by authoring studies about the treatment and experiences of racially/ethnically marginalized authors in speculative literature.

She is the author of _A Ruin of Shadows_ (Dancing Star Press, 2018), and her published short fiction and poetry includes appearances in _FIYAH_, _PodCastle_, _Strange Horizons_, _Anathema: Spec from the Margins_, _Lightspeed Magazine_, and _Fireside Magazine_, among others.

She lives in Georgia, on perpetual deadline, with her coffee habit, two demon cats, and an impressive Funko Pop! collection.

## Content Notes
Fireside provides content notes for books and stories to guide readers who may wish to seek out or avoid particular story elements. These content notes may contain spoilers.

Content notes are not the same as the ratings found on movies, TV shows, and video games. The intent is to help trauma survivors avoid being surprised by story elements that may trigger pain or emotional distress, so we don’t offer warnings about general violence, profanity, sex, or other things one sees in a movie rating.

We welcome suggestions for elements to include or exclude. You can email us at [editorial@firesidefiction.com](mailto:editorial@firesidefiction.com). (Please do _not_ send submissions here. Any stories sent to this address will be deleted unread.)

Here are a few of the elements we currently offer notes for:

- Drug or alcohol abuse
- Animal abuse
- Abuse of, harm to, or death of a child
- Domestic violence
- Gender-Bias Violence
- LGBTQIA-Bias Violence
- Racial/Ethnic-Bias Violence
- Self-Harm or Suicide
- Sexual Assault
- Torture
