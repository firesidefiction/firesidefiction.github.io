## What is Fireside?
Fireside Fiction Company started in 2012 as a Kickstarter-funded short-story magazine. We began with the goals of finding and publishing great stories regardless of genre, and paying our writers well. Since Nov. 8, 2016, we have a third goal: resisting the global rise of fascism and far-right populism, starting with the current occupant of the White House.

For general inquiries, please contact [questions@firesidefiction.com](mailto:questions@firesidefiction.com). For press requests, please email [marketing@firesidefiction.com](mailto:marketing@firesidefiction.com).

## Fair pay for everyone
Fair pay is a big deal for us. We think creative people should be able to make a living from their work. This is one of our [core values](../values.html).

Fireside pays USD 12.5 cents per word, well above the 8 cents currently considered to be the minimum professional rate. In fact, we pay better than almost every other [<abbr title="Sif Wah">SFWA</abbr>-qualifying market](http://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#short). For illustrations, we pay $400 for a full-color piece.

## Fireside is brought to you by:

### Brian White — Founding Editor
Brian started Fireside in 2012 with a Kickstarter and a whole lot of love. Over the next five years as editor and publisher – with the help of his amazing team and of Lauren, his wife and partner in crime – he expanded Fireside from a one-off magazine to a monthly publication to its current form, a site with weekly fiction and occasional nonfiction. Fireside published 150 stories under his tenure, as well as five novels and one novella. He is deeply proud to have had a part in bringing those stories into the world. He was gratified to have proved that writers can be paid more for their work than the industry accepted, and perhaps most proud of the [\#BlackSpecFic](https://medium.com/fireside-fiction-company/antiblack-racism-in-speculative-fiction-7e30eff97008) report that Fireside published in 2016. He stepped down as editor and publisher in the [summer of 2017](/teach-me-how-to-say-goodbye), but he remains an equity partner in the company.

## Content Notes
Fireside provides content notes for books and stories to guide readers who may wish to seek out or avoid particular story elements. These content notes may contain spoilers.

Content notes are not the same as the ratings found on movies, TV shows, and video games. The intent is to help trauma survivors avoid being surprised by story elements that may trigger pain or emotional distress. So we don’t offer warnings about general violence, profanity, sex, or other things one sees in a movie rating.

We welcome suggestions for elements to include or exclude. You can email us at [editorial@firesidefiction.com](mailto:editorial@firesidefiction.com). (Please do _not_ send submissions here. Any stories sent to this address will be deleted unread.)

Here is a list of some of the elements we currently offer notes for:

- Alcohol Abuse
- Animal Abuse
- Child Abuse
- Child Death
- Domestic Violence
- Drug Abuse
- Emotional Abuse
- Gender-Bias Violence
- LGBTQ-Bias Violence
- Racial/Ethnic-Bias Violence
- Self-Harm
- Sexual Assault
- Suicide
- Torture
